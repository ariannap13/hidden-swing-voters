It can be hard not to feel hopeless in the face of this shocking picture, but the truth is we do not have time for despair. To protect life as we know it on our planet, we must act now. Failing to do so would represent an unforgiveable betrayal of future generations. World leaders hold the key to solving this crisis - they can press fast-forward on the all-important changes we need to see, from a shift to sustainable food production and renewable energy, to investing in nature, and the people and communities who depend upon it, as our greatest ally in the fight against climate change.Leaders on the global stage, including our Prime Minister, must find the courage to act to bring our world back to life, before our natural riches are gone forever. The COP15 Biodiversity Summit in December with representatives from nearly 200 countries expected to attend is one of the few opportunities we have left to come together, as a global community, and put people and planet first. At this Summit, world leaders must raise their ambition and agree to enshrine the protection and restoration for nature, our life support system, into law. And we know the British public care - 81 percent of UK adults believe nature is under threat and that more needs to be done urgently to protect and restore it. The UK Government has already set out its plans and promises. Now it must stick to them and show the world it is proud to play a leadership role in tackling the nature and climate crises.What we know for sure is that when given a chance nature can recover. I recently witnessed this first hand, when I saw a myriad of bird species from skylarks to pink-footed geese on a visit to once-degraded farmland on the beautiful north Norfolk coast, thanks to farmers adopting nature friendly approaches that restore the fertility of the soils, bring back lost habitats and clean our waterways, at the same time as producing the food we need. Further afield, the black rhino population is recovering in Kenya, rising almost 10 percent to 938 individuals since 2020, and Nepal is celebrating a near tripling of its tiger population in just over a decade. We have the solutions. We can bring back thriving habitats, with an abundance of wildlife. We can make space for nature. Doing so will help safeguard a stable climate and ultimately protect us all. If we can hold on to nature, we can hold on to hope.","Around the world we are witnessing a nature catastrophe, says TANYA STEELE Around the world we are witnessing a nature catastrophe.

10069,eutimes-9ae04d41b95c4bb047c033a65269e1d2,2022-01-22 18:50:00,"Campaigners, researchers and commentators demanding action on climate change have a tendency to err on the side of catastrophe when discussing what the world might look like in the future. Greta Thunberg’s famous statement, “I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic,” is an obvious example. Even that three-word mantra ‘save the planet’ is positively febrile, since there is nothing in any scientific literature to suggest the planet needs saving. So it should come as no surprise that the UK government’s weather and climate centre, the Met Office, is seriously kicking around some terrifying scenarios for the future. The Met Office, in conjunction with a group of other research bodies, has come up with five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways for Climate Research and Policy (UK-SSPs). These are a UK-specific version of the global scenarios used in assessments by the United Nations’ climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and described as “five different storylines of future socioeconomic circumstances, explaining how the global economy and society might evolve over the next 80 years”. The project website explains that “the global SSPs are independent of climate change and climate change policy” – in other words, “they do not consider the potential impact climate change has on societal and economic choices”. Rather, they are “coupled with a set of future climate scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways” to allow researchers to see “how feasible it would be to achieve different levels of climate change mitigation, and what challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation might exist”. These UK-specific scenarios have actually been around since last summer, so it’s not entirely clear why the British press has picked up on them now. But some of them would make decent backstories for dystopian movies. Take SSP3, titled ‘Regional Rivalry’. To cut a long story short, the UK falls out catastrophically with the rest of the world, nationalist leaders take over, there is a crackdown on environmentalist groups, the local environment gets screwed up, incomes fall and, eventually, functioning government in the four nations of the UK – having gone their separate ways – collapses. By the end of the 21st century, “Because of past investments in military and defence, but without an effective central government, different military groups (militias, criminal groups, etc.) rise to de facto power and compete for control and natural resources, creating their own feudal semi-independent micro-states with their own laws and means to enforce them. People accept severe restrictions on freedom in exchange for employment and protection.” What? In short, the UK, after centuries of developing democratic political structures, a wealthy economy and extensive infrastructure descends into a condition more like present-day Afghanistan. Yet apparently intelligent people think this is a scenario worth taking into account when analysing the possibilities for climate change impacts. Compare this to SSP1, titled ‘Sustainability’. In this one, environmental problems and natural disasters lead people to work together for a more sustainable society. “Society becomes more egalitarian, with all individuals actively contributing to the sustainability agenda. A UK-wide green alliance is established across countries and delivers the policies and technologies that maximise sustainability. Collaboration domestically and internationally plays a key role in the green alliance, ensuring technologies, ideas and projects are shared to gain mutual benefits. By 2100, the UK becomes a fully functional circular economy.” If the ‘Regional Rivalry’ scenario is a dystopia, the ‘Sustainability’ scenario is an eco-warrior’s wet dream. Still, it’s not all bad news. There’s another scenario, SSP5, titled ‘Fossil-fuelled Development’. In this one, public support for green taxation falls and people carry on using fossil fuels. Shale gas, extracted using fracking, takes off, leading to lower prices for energy and wider economic development, particularly in the north of England where the biggest supplies of shale gas are found. Soon, the UK’s north-south economic divide disappears. “Technological solutions are used to counter the impacts of large-scale environmental degradation. Large increases in population lead to rapidly expanding ‘city-states’ and massive urban sprawl.”",How climate change alarmism has turned into pure fantasy

A recent survey using American summer temperatures (June, July, August) over the last 50 years, found that 36 major climate models showed nearly twice the warming rate observed by the surface temperature measurements recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). At the high end, a number of models forecast warming nearly three times greater than observed data show (blue bar below).The research was carried out by Dr. Roy Spencer, the principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the compiler of the UAH monthly satellite temperature record. He says that the importance of his findings should be obvious. ""Given that U.S. energy policy depends upon the predictions from these models, their tendency to produce too much warming (and likely also warming-associated climate change) should be factored into energy policy planning,"" he said. But he doubted it was being, ""given the climate change exaggerations routinely promoted by environment groups, anti-oil advocates, the media, politicians, and most government agencies"". The Spencer work follows recent research published by Professor Nicola Scafetta of the University of Naples. He found that almost all the global temperature forecasts produced by models between 1980-2021 were excessive, some extremely so, compared with the accurate satellite record. One of the reasons given as to why there's no climate emergency in the World Climate Declaration is that climate models are ""not remotely plausible as global tools"". Yet as we have seen in numerous articles in the Daily Sceptic , climate models are ubiquitous and are at the forefront of promoting the climate scares pushing the command-and-control Net Zero agenda. They are at the heart of the pseudoscientific work that tries to 'attribute' single extreme weather events to long-term changes in the climate claimed supposedly caused by fossil fuels. In simple terms, computers compare an imaginary climate without human-caused carbon dioxide with the current one full of unknown complexities, and then the modellers announce they've 'proved' the 'climate emergency' hypothesis. Since the outputs of these models are unfalsifiable - how can you prove that a wholly imaginary scenario is 'false'? - the notions are no more than worthless opinions. The results of Spencer's work will hardly come as a great surprise, but the conclusions are almost certainly more damaging to the climate catastrophisers' case than the figures suggest. Spencer uses NOAA surface temperatures and, as we have seen, these are subject to 'corruption' from a number of causes in recent years. As Spencer notes, the NOAA figure could be an over-estimate ""if increasing urban heat island effects have spuriously influenced trends over the last 50 years, and I have not made any adjustments for that"". Earlier this year, the U.S. meteorologist Anthony Watts published his latest survey of NOAA's nationwide weather stations. Describing the temperature record as ""fatally flawed"", Watts found about 96% of US temperature stations failed to meet what NOAA itself considered to be acceptable and uncorrupted placement. Watts defined 'corruption' as caused by the localised effects of urbanisation, producing heat bias because of a close proximity to asphalt, machinery and other heat-producing, heat-trapping, or heat-accentuating objects . According to Watts, data that had not been corrupted by faulty placement showed a rate of warming in the U.S. ""reduced by almost a half compared to all stations"".There is further substantial evidence that NOAA's U.S. surface temperature figures are too high. In 2005, it started compiling data from a select group of 114 stations across the country that had been specifically sited away from urban development. Called the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN), it was intended to aim for ""superior accuracy and continuity in places that land use will not likely impact during the next five decades"".",Dozens of climate models wildly exaggerate the extent of global warming

The Sun's former royal correspondent Charles Rae spoke on GB News about Prince William's plans to shake up his role as King in waiting and his plans to adopt 's royal strategy model.Mr Rae said: ""It seems like he and Catherine want to concentrate on five or six core charity projects, which was what Prince Philip did, rather than the myriad of charities that the Prince of Wales is involved in. ""That doesn't mean that he's going to ignore all these other charities, it just means he's going to concentrate on some of them."" The former royal correspondent said that now ""this is going to look like as if it's a rift between father and son but it isn't really, it's just a reshaping of the role.""Speaking of Prince Charles' role as future King, Mr Rae said: ""Prince Charles has made it mean something, he started the Prince's Trust."" Referring back to Prince William, he said: ""He may not concentrate so much on the Prince's Trust but he will concentrate more on his foundation that he started with Prince Harry which in effect does the same sort of job. ""It's there to help people, give them a leg up in life so that, you know, perform well in society.""

Wind Turbine Issues. Generating all of America’s power currently provided by fossil fuel and nuclear power (> 8 billion megawatt-hours) with wind energy would require 2.12 million turbines on 500,682 square miles of farm, wildlife habitat, and scenic lands. This land area is equivalent to the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and West Virginia combined, according to the policy brief Protecting the Environment from the Green New Deal published in 2019 by The Heartland Institute. Many wind turbine projects invariably encounter the NIMBY response (not in my backyard) from potential neighbors, especially wealthy neighbors. Wind turbines create noise pollution, both audible and inaudible low-frequency noise, which can cause sleep disturbance and headaches in humans. Wind projects are invariably targeted for low-income counties where opponents don’t have as much money to fight back. There are significant environmental costs associated with mining and refining rare earth elements for wind turbines. For example, writing for MIT News in his article “ Clean energy could lead to scarce materials ,” D.L. Chandler explains that approximately one ton of neodymium magnets is needed for each 5-MW wind turbine. And processing of rare earth elements creates a radioactive waste byproduct. Preparation of land for many wind farms does extensive environmental damage, often necessitating removal of thousands of trees and bulldozing of hills and valleys. Since 2015, from Maine to Hawaii, there have been more than 300 rejections or restrictions of wind projects, relates Robert Bryce in “Here’s the List of 317 Wind Energy Rejections the Sierra Club Doesn’t Want You to See” for Forbes. Actual electricity output is rarely as advertised, often hitting 20 percent or lower depending on location (according to the Centre for Sustainable Energy’s “Common Concerns about Wind Power”) — and failing completely on the hottest and coldest days when electricity is most urgently needed. Electricity output declines by 16 percent per decade of operation — and worse than that offshore because of storms and salt spray — says the Renewable Energy Foundation in “The Performance of Wind Farms in the United Kingdom and Denmark.” Environment & Climate News explains in “States, Localities Face High Wind Turbine Decommissioning Costs” that wind turbine lifetime is about 10 years for offshore turbines, about 20 years for onshore turbines. Solar Panel Issues. Generating all of America’s power currently provided by fossil fuel and nuclear power (> 8 billion megawatt-hours) with solar energy would require 18.7 billion solar panels on 57,024 square miles of land. This land area is equivalent to the states of New York and Vermont combined, says The Heartland Institute. Solar panels and their manufacturing processes necessitate many toxic chemicals, including lead, cadmium telluride, copper indium selenide, cadmium gallium (di)selenide, copper indium gallium (di)selenide, hexafluoroethane, and polyvinyl fluoride, according to David Nguyen writing for Sciencing in his 2019 article “Toxic Chemicals in Solar Panels.” Incredibly, these processes generate 300 times more toxic waste per unit of energy than nuclear power plants, per Jemin Desai and Mark Nelson in “Are We Headed for a Solar Waste Crisis?,” published in Environmental Progress News. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) deems toxic nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3 ), used in some solar panel construction, to be over 17,000 times more potent than CO 2 as a greenhouse gas, as recorded by the University of California at San Diego News Center in “Potent Greenhouse Gas More Prevalent in Atmosphere than Previously Assumed.” Solar panels last about 25 years, according to the Journal of Energy Research and Reviews’ “On the Ability of Wind and Solar Electric Generation to Power Modern Civilization,” but high temperatures can accelerate the aging process for solar cells, and snow, dust, and other natural events can cause material fatigue on the surface and in internal electric circuits — gradually reducing a panel’s power output.The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, up to 78 million tons of solar panels will have reached the end of their life and the world will create another six million tons of photovoltaic waste every year. Disposal of solar panels in landfills is not appropriate as they contain toxic materials, and the cost of recycled materials is significantly more than the raw material cost. Currently, U.S. solar panel manufacturers are not even required to, and do not, collect and dispose of solar panel manufacturing toxic waste. Battery Energy Storage System Issues. There is an almost complete disconnect between current efforts of small research grants and pilot programs to investigate which of various new energy storage technologies might work in a 100-percent renewables scenario and a multi-hundred-trillion-dollar total transformation of the entire energy economy that will supposedly be accomplished by 2035 using technology not yet invented, let alone demonstrated at scale. The topic is explored in Francis Menton’s 2022 “Report on the Status of the U.S. Energy Storage Project.” Additionally, the real battery issues associated with a 100-percent renewables grid have yet to be seriously addressed. Backup batteries are generally proposed as the solution to the intermittency problem of solar and wind energy. Batteries are not electricity generators — they have to be recharged constantly, and the mechanism for charging them is the very solar and wind generators whose intermittency causes the energy deficiency in the first place. The off-grid system must be designed to provide a charge current capable of recharging batteries quickly and efficiently, and within the window of time the on-grid system is generating peak power. And battery energy storage systems generally can’t sustain output for more than several hours, at best. Backup battery storage requirements for the electricity demands of the entire U.S. would be absolutely staggering. Issues not being addressed include: How many batteries would be required to provide adequate backup electricity to the “green” grid when parts of the U.S. experience extended wind and sun downtimes? Do sufficient raw materials even exist? How would we dispose of huge amounts of toxic waste from battery manufacturing? Lithium batteries contain both oxidizers and fuel within the enclosed battery space, and therefore carry risk of fire and explosion in case of overcharging, over-discharging, excess current, or short circuits. Currently there is no single standard or parameter for assessing battery safety and no fire-prevention system design standards or test criteria for battery energy storage systems. At the scale necessary to supplement on-demand “renewable” generated electricity, the cost of backup battery storage systems makes anything even close to 100 percent renewables economically impossible, according to the February 2020 edition of Environment & Climate News. The obvious rational conclusion to be drawn from this series of articles is that believing existing solar, wind, and energy storage technologies make possible a rapid and wholesale replacement of fossil fuels ignores the underlying physics, engineering, and economics. The only serious discussion with respect to replacing fossil fuels for electricity generation is nuclear energy, without which there will never be enough electricity to support an all-electric vehicle transportation system. And a 100-percent renewables economy is not even remotely possible. Other articles in this series: Back to Energy’s Future? —",Back to Energy’s Future? — Part 7

China has decided to cut diplomatic ties with the US in a number of military and civilian areas, the Foreign Ministry announced on Friday. The devolvement of ties is Beijing’s way of retaliating for this week’s visit to Taiwan by Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. The ministry released a list of areas in which there will no longer be communication between Chinese and American officials. It includes working meetings between defense departments, maritime security consultation, cooperation on illegal migration, judicial assistance, transnational crime, drug control, and climate change. A planned phone call between senior military commanders of the two nations has also been canceled, the statement said. Earlier on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced personal sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family members.Pelosi visited Taiwan this week despite repeated objections from Beijing. The self-governed island is claimed as part of China, with the US formally acknowledging the One-China policy since the 1970s. Washington maintained informal ties with Taipei even after switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing. Over the past several years, subsequent American administrations have increasingly treated Taiwan’s government as representing a sovereign nation. Beijing says Washington is deliberately undermining the status quo and encouraging separatism in Taiwan. While the White House tried to distance itself from Pelosi, claiming it was her independent decision to visit Taiwan, officials in Beijing took it as part of a perceived policy to undermine its claim, and threatened consequences. China’s People’s Liberation Army launched major exercises around the island, which Chinese media described as a rehearsal of a full blockade.

Financial incentives can affect behavior, which is why the public and Congress need to know who funded the skeptics’ research. And companies that produce harmful products want to foment uncertainty about well-established health and safety risks: fossil fuel interests and climate chaos skeptics are just like the tobacco industry. These senators are abusing their power of office to threaten and silence honest scientists , and destroy their funding, reputations and careers. It’s pure Saul Alinsky, as practiced by Greenpeace, Harry Reid and the other White House: “In a fight almost anything goes. Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” And the vilified scientists and their friends are just supposed to take it, the senators seem to think. In reality, the only thing overheated is Mr. Whitehouse’s temper and the increasingly preposterous rhetoric about an overheating planet. Climate change is altering our music . A 0.1 degree Celsius change in ocean temperatures has caused whales to migrate a month earlier than 30 years ago. Warming oceans will mean the end of fish and chips ! Lord knows what other “disasters” await all because of fossil fuels. The absurdity of this fraudulent fear mongering and its total irrelevance to our daily lives explains why Americans consistently put climate change at the bottom of every list of concerns. The very idea that governments can decree an idyllic climate is equally crazy; that has happenedNo wonder Mr. Obama is repackaging the climate issue under the equally false and ridiculous mantras of “ ocean acidification ,” and “carbon pollution” causing allergies and asthma . Our oceans are not becoming acidic. It’s not “carbon” it’s carbon dioxide, the miracle molecule that makes all life on Earth possible. And neither CO2 nor planetary warming has anything to do with allergies or asthma. Climate science was supposed to examine the effects that humans might be having on Earth’s climate. But anti-fossil fuel activists turned it into the notion that only humans affect the climate and that the powerful natural forces that caused countless, sometimes devastating climate fluctuations in the past no longer play a role. Climatology was also supposed to be about the scientific method. By now, it’s obvious that the “dangerous manmade global warming” thesis, and computer models based on it, do not explain what is happening in the real world. The planet stopped warming 18 years ago, despite rising fossil fuel use and CO2 emissions. The models don’t work; their predictions are completely out of whack with reality. Instead of more hurricanes, no Category 3-5 has hit the mainland U.S. since late 2005. So the alarmists changed their mantra to “climate change” and “weather disruption.” But this is bogus: it tries to blame every change and event on fossil fuels. The thesis can never be proven or disproven, which means it’s a religious tract, not a scientific analysis. Alarmists don’t have a leg to stand on scientifically.That’s why they refuse to debate the science; why they vilify climate crisis skeptics. It’s why Democrats became so frustrated with Dr. Judith Curry’s expert testimony at a recent House Science Committee hearing that they left the room. They couldn’t stand it when she said the “central issue” is the extent to which recent (and future) planetary warming or other climate changes are driven by manmade greenhouse gas emissions , “versus natural climate variability caused by variations from the sun, volcanic eruptions, and large-scale ocean circulations.” And they really couldn’t tolerate her noting that President Obama’s pledge to slash U.S. emissions by 28% will reduce warming by just 0.03 degrees Celsius by 2100. Climate change and extreme weather risks are real, but carbon dioxide doesn’t cause them today any more than throughout history. Aside from Pleistocene-style ice ages, we can adapt or respond to events including storms, droughts, heat waves and extreme cold if we have affordable, reliable energy, strong economies and modern technologies. The real threats to jobs, health, welfare and lives come from anti-fossil fuel policies imposed on the pretense that they will stabilize weather and climate. Forecasting future climate changes will be equally impossible if we remain fixated on carbon dioxide, and ignore the solar, ocean circulation, cosmic ray and other powerful natural forces that actually affect Earth’s climate. Senator Whitehouse’s suggestion that climate chaos skeptics should be tarred and feathered with tobacco industry apologists is despicable demagoguery. So are his comments about funding realist research. The skeptics’ funding was never secret. It was always an open book, available to anyone who cared to look. But since he brought up the money issue, let’s look at a few aspects that he studiously ignores. Alarmist research is all about carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases and fossil fuels precisely because financial incentives can and do affect behavior. Alarmists get a thousand times more money than skeptics. Climate Crisis, Inc. received hundreds of billions of dollars in government, industry, foundation and other money during the past couple decades. The U.S. government alone spent over $186 billion in tax dollars on climate, “clean energy” and renewable energy projects from 2009 through 2014. Applicants know they won’t get grants if their theses and conclusions do not support climate alarmism and regulatory agendas. Billions more went to government agencies that coordinate these programs and develop anti-hydrocarbon regulations. These bureaucrats don’t merely search health and scientific files to cherry-pick papers that support their agenda. They deliberately hunt only for supportive documents (many of which they pay for) and actively ignore, suppress and vilify research that focuses on (or even just discusses) natural forces. Then the EPA and other agencies pay the American Lung Association, scientific advisory committees and other activists millions of dollars a year to rubber-stamp their regulatory decisions. Even more destructive of our scientific method and political process, countless millions are also being funneled to climate chaos researchers and Big Green pressure groups via secretive foundations, laundered through front groups from Russian oil interests, and employed to furtherlike Warren Buffett. The scandalous system has turned hardcore environmentalism into a $13.4-billion-per-year operation and represents an unbelievable abuse of our hard-earned tax dollars and the tax-exempt status of numerous foundations and activist groups. Cooperate and get rich; resist, and get the Whitehouse inquisition. As a result, instead of science, we get opinion, propaganda, spin, pseudo-science and outright fraud all designed to advance a anti-fossil fuel, pro-renewable energy agenda, that kills jobs and economic growth, endangers human health and welfare, and puts radical regulators and pressure groups in control of our lives, livelihoods and living standards. It also further corrupts our political system. These Big Green companies, foundations, pressure groups and government unions give our politicians millions of dollars in campaign cash and in-kind help, to keep them in office and the gravy train on track. The League of Conservation Voters collected $90 million in foundation grants 2000-2013; the LCV Education Fund pocketed $71 million more. The LCV, Sierra Club, NRDC, SEIU, AFSCME, Kleiner Perkins and allied groups are all big Whitehouse (and Obama White House) campaign donors. Do Senators Whitehouse, Boxer and Markey plan to investigate those financial incentives and abuses? Concerned citizens should ponder all of this on Earth Day, April 22 and the next time they vote.

733,summit-238c9340110b79c9411123128e682c01,2022-02-01 18:39:00,"A group of environmental economists in Germany is demanding that huge taxes be imposed on meat products to fight climate change, with calls for beef to be 56 per cent more expensive. Asserting that livestock is responsible for 13 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, researchers from TU Berlin’s Chair of Sustainable Use of Natural Resources are demanding limitations on meat consumption in order to “attain greenhouse gas neutrality.” “Livestock farming is a huge contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, soil and water pollution, and precious forests are being cleared for pastures and food crops,” said the leader of the group, Professor Linus Mattauch. “Evidence suggests the environmental impacts are so large that the world can’t meet climate goals and keep vital ecosystems intact without reducing the consumption of meat – at least in Western high-income countries,” he added. Mattauch wants governments to “start thinking about also taxing meat to reduce its consumption,” asserting that this is the “most efficient path to preventing further strain on our planet.” “According to the group’s model calculations, the direct cost of livestock farming in relation to climate change is as high as $9.21 per kilogram of beef,” reports ReMix News . “Applying this cost to the price of beef could result in beef products being as much as 56 percent more expensive. Similarly, poultry would cost 25 percent more, and lamb and pork would rise by 19 percent.” Such taxes will of course primarily impact the poor, who in many western countries are already suffering due to rampant food inflation. No doubt the solution to that will be amplifying efforts to encourage everyone to start eating bugs as an alternative and “sustainable” source of protein. As we previously highlighted , the World Economic Forum published two articles on its website which explored how people could be conditioned to get used to the idea of eating weeds, bugs and drinking sewage water in order to reduce CO2 emissions. In January last year, the EU officially approved the sale of worms as food to be consumed by humans. Last month, Vanderbilt University Professor Amanda Little argued that everyone in the world needs to start dining on insects and that the EU’s approval of them conferred a form of “dignity” to their consumption. One group of people who won’t be eating bugs is technocrat globalists. Despite insisting that everyone else reduce their living standards and ration their meat eating to save the planet, during last year’s Cop 26 summit, attendees enjoyed a menu full of animal-based dishes that were at least double the carbon footprint of the average UK meal.

He told Express.co.uk : “The key problem came towards winter, where we struggled to adjust ourselves as to how to use the heating. “You have to use it for much longer periods (than a gas boiler). You don’t get sudden bursts of energy like with a gas boiler where you can ping it on and within 30 minutes the house is warm. But with a heat pump, it can take several hours. And in the deep period of winter, it took about 12 hours to raise the temperature from about 12 degrees up to about 17 or 18 degrees. It was tough. A lot of coats were worn and blankets were used, but we sort of got used to handling it.“ He added that in his experience, “gas boilers are so much easier, and so much warmer”. But problems did not end there, as not only was the heat pump not as effective as a gas boiler, but it was also incredibly “noisy”. READ MORE: Steve Baker vows to tear up UK's energy plans: 'Disaster Mr McDonald's Mitsubishi Ecodan air source heat pump came with his new build flatAnd Mr McDonald agreed, warning those not in a new build to stay away from heat pumps. He said: “I would say the technology will develop further and better. But unless you are in a new build, I would say don’t go for it. “If you are in an old building, particularly a conservation area, you have got a nightmare as you may not get permission to get added insulation (which is needed for the heat pump to work properly), so I would say avoid it at all costs.” But even though Mr McDonald, who moved into a new build property that industry insider Mr Foster described as being ideal for heat pump technology, he still experienced problems. And despite being under the impression that he could save money right from the off, Mr McDonald said his heating bills were still “high” in the first couple of months.But he did note that after getting used to the technology, the bill came down to a reasonable price. And he added that everyone in the development that he lives in (each household has a heat pump installed) is paying different bills depending on the way they use the heat pumps. Mr McDonald said: “The jury is out, getting the thing to runall our people in our community, when they move in say ‘what’s wrong, I can’t figure out how to use this..it’s noisy. When we were getting bills of about 120-150 (per month) in the winter because we were careful, other people were paying 200-250. “And with all the price rises, if they don’t get their act together they could be facing bills of about 5,000 a year. It doesn’t shield you from the rising gas prices at all.” But energy regulator Ofgem has set a maximum annual tariff that energy suppliers can charge, which is expected to reach nearly 3,000 in October.This also comes after the Climate Change Committee, which advises the Government, warned that heat pumps’ running costs are 10 percent higher than gas boilers. At a time when bills are rising, Westminster has also set a deadline of 2035 for households to install a new boiler, likely to encourage people to switch to heat pumps. But Mike Foster, CEO of the Energy and utility Alliance, has said that incentivising households to install heat pumps instead is “just mad”. He said: “Government officials and Government targets are forcing people down the route of higher heating bills at the same time as people calling out for help with their energy bills. Despite the cost-of-living crisis, despite the situation in Ukraine having a knock-on effect on our energy bills it’s just perverse.” A BEIS spokesperson said: “We are incentivising millions of people to get a heat pump by offering grants to slash the price of installation by 5,000 or more and by cutting VAT to 0 percent, and we are working with industry to further bring down the upfront cost of heat pumps by up to half by 2025. Later this year we will publish proposals on how to move costs away from electricity bills to ensure heat pumps are comparatively cheap to run over time. In doing so we will consider the impact on bills, particularly for low-income consumers.”",‘Avoid at all costs’ Heat pump owner blows top over boiler alternative: 'Winter was tough'

Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration said yesterday that we would once again have blackouts this summer. What’s going on? Gavin Newsom's aides yesterday said climate change may soon cause blackouts, but that's ridiculous: we've known about climate change for decades. The reason for four years of blackouts in a row is because Newsom won't build the power plants we need. Now, people could die. pic.twitter.com/t3sbL7k1ST — Michael Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD)… climate change. That and the fact that people might actually use their air conditioners this summer. This is bonkers. We Californians pay more for electricity than anyone else in the country except people in Hawaii. And we’ve known for years that we needed to build more natural gas plants.But Gavin and his people are acting surprised. I mean, who could have ever predicted that climate change would make things hotter? Do you know what happens when there are blackouts and people can’t use their air conditioners? They die. From homelessness and crime to energy, water, and forest fires, Newsom only makes things worse. He then looks around for someone to blame. And when there isn’t someone to blame, he blames climate change. The problem isn’t that Newsom isn’t running California. It’s that he’s running it into the ground. That and running for president. And that means he wants the big money support of powerful anti-energy, pro-scarcity interests.Not me. For the last six years I have been warning the people of California that shutting down nuclear plants, not building enough natural gas plants , and over-relying on weather dependent renewables would be a disaster. I testified to Congress SIX TIMES warning of the disaster that’s now unfolding. There’s a role for renewables. I have solar panels in my backyard. But the fifth largest economy in the world can’t rely on the weather, particularly not during a time of climate change. The same week California generated nearly 100% of its electricity from renewables, it The problem with weather-dependent renewables is that they produce too much energy when we don’t need it and not enough when we do. It was misleading for people to point to a few minutes during one day when energy from renewables matched demand for electricity. The rest of the time they aren’t matched, which is why they make electricity so expensive.Our electricity rates rose seven times more than they did in the rest of the US over the last 10 years. And now Newsom’s people say they will raise electricity rates up to 9 percent every year over the next three years. California needs abundant and reliable energy.

What are the general ethical limits in the world where the potential of science and machines are becoming almost boundless? ... Some people in the West believe that an aggressive elimination of entire pages from their own history, 'reverse discrimination' against the majority in the interests of a minority, and the demand to give up the traditional notions of mother, father, family and even gender, they believe that all of these are the mileposts on the path towards social renewal. ""Listen, I would like to point out once again that they have a right to do this, we are keeping out of this. But we would like to ask them to keep out of our business as well. We have a different viewpoint, at least the overwhelming majority of Russian society — it would be more correct to put it this way — has a different opinion on this matter. We believe that we must rely on our own spiritual values, our historical tradition, and the culture of our multiethnic nation. ""The advocates of so-called 'social progress' believe they are introducing humanity to some kind of a new and better consciousness. Godspeed, hoist the flags, as we say, go right ahead. The only thing that I want to say now is that their prescriptions are not new at all. It may come as a surprise to some people, but Russia has been there already. After the 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks, relying on the dogmas of Marx and Engels, also said that they would change existing ways and customs, and not just political and economic ones, but the very notion of human morality and the foundations of a healthy society. The destruction of age-old values, religion, and relations between people, up to and including the total rejection of family (we had that, too), encouragement to inform on loved ones - all this was proclaimed progress and, by the way, was widely supported around the world back then and was quite fashionable, same as today. By the way, the Bolsheviks were absolutely intolerant of opinions other than theirs. ""This, I believe, should call to mind some of what we are witnessing now. Looking at what is happening in a number of Western countries, we are amazed to see the domestic practices - which we, fortunately, have left, I hope - in the distant past. The fight for equality and against discrimination has turned into aggressive dogmatism bordering on absurdity, when the works of the great authors of the past - such as Shakespeare - are no longer taught at schools or universities, because their ideas are believed to be backward. The classics are declared backward and ignorant of the importance of gender or race. In Hollywood, memos are distributed about proper storytelling and how many characters of what color or gender should be in a movie. This is even worse than the agitprop department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. ""Countering acts of racism is a necessary and noble cause, but the new 'cancel culture' has turned it into 'reverse discrimination' - that is, reverse racism. The obsessive emphasis on race is further dividing people, when the real fighters for civil rights dreamed precisely about erasing differences and refusing to divide people by skin color. I specifically asked my colleagues to find the following quote from Martin Luther King: 'I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by their character.' This is the true value. However, things are turning out differently there. By the way, the absolute majority of Russian people do not think that the color of a person's skin or their gender is an important matter. Each of us is a human being. This is what matters. ""In a number of Western countries, the debate over men's and women's rights has turned into a perfect phantasmagoria. Look, beware of going where the Bolsheviks once planned to go - not only communalizing chickens, but also communalizing women. One more step and you will be there."" Putin then adds: ""Zealots of these new approaches even go so far as to want to abolish these concepts altogether. Anyone who dares mention that men and women actually exist, which is a biological fact, risks being ostracized. 'Parent number one' and 'parent number two,' 'birthing parent' instead of 'mother,' and 'human milk' replacing 'breastmilk' because it might upset the people who are unsure about their own gende r. I repeat, this is nothing new; in the 1920s, the so-called Soviet Kulturtraegers also invented some newspeak believing they were creating a new consciousness and changing values that way. And, as I have already said, they made such a mess it still makes one shudder at times. ""Not to mention some truly monstrous things when children are taught from an early age that a boy can easily become a girl and vice versa. That is, the teachers actually impose on them a choice we all supposedly have. They do so while shutting the parents out of the process and forcing the child to make decisions that can upend their entire life. They do not even bother to consult with child psychologists - is a child at this age even capable of making a decision of this kind? Calling a spade a spade, this verges on a crime against humanity, and it is being done in the name and under the banner of progress. ""Well, if someone likes this, let them do it. I have already mentioned that, in shaping our approaches, we will be guided by a healthy conservatism. That was a few years ago, when passions on the international arena were not yet running as high as they are now, although, of course, we can say that clouds were gathering even then. Now, when the world is going through a structural disruption, the importance of reasonable conservatism as the foundation for a political course has skyrocketed - precisely because of the multiplying risks and dangers, and the fragility of the reality around us."" Conclusion Putin has smartly introduced himself into the debate that already exists in the Western world about liberalism, and more specifically progressive liberalism. If Putin manages to outline a new conservative ideology, then Russia would become a political and ideological pole for conservatives also in the U.S. and Europe. This is already partly happening in some European countries. Ironically, we could witness a new Cold War, but with reversed roles: the West would be a pole for progressive-liberal-communist ideology while Russia would represent the conservative pole. Even more ironically, Eastern European countries that rebelled against the Soviet Union, mainly Hungary and Poland, now have conservative elected governments that in the future may look at Moscow as an ideological point of reference. Of course, when Putin talks about ""healthy conservatism,"" he is not referring to Ronald Reagan's liberal-conservatism, since the main nature of the Russian regime remains authoritarian. Karaganov actually described Russia's political system as authoritarian democracy.[7] It is worth noting that Karaganov believes that that the whole world is moving toward ""a kind of combination of authoritarian democracy or democratic authoritarianism.""[8] Putin also thinks so. In particular, he sees the West's progressive liberalism as intolerant of other people's views in the same way that Bolshevism was. This view is also shared by conservatives in the West. For example, British conservative political commentator John O'Sullivan, former vice president and executive editor of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, noted: ""Liberal democracy[9]... has policies and prohibitions built into its ideological structure. It is not really open to institutions and policies that run counter to its 'liberationist' instincts. It increasingly restricts their freedom to maneuver on anything from parental rights to national sovereignty. It is even hostile to some fundamental values of liberalism such as free speech. Accordingly, it sometimes comes up against the wishes of the voters expressed in elections and referenda.""[10] It is also worth noting that as much as Russia wants to look East, it continues to mainly look West. The search to shape an ideology is aimed to compete politically with the West, while simultaneously attracting conservatives in the West who no longer have strong leadership. Despite Russia's willingness to ally itself with China, the Kremlin openly criticizes Communist ideology as outdated and totalitarian, showing that Moscow will never be subordinate to Beijing. As Putin said: ""Beware of going where the Bolsheviks once planned to go"" Furthermore, to shape a new ideology for Russia means ""sovereignty,"" as Karaganov explains.[11] It means to have influence and to project power to further its political and economic interests. After the fall of the Soviet Union, a many of the Russian elites were reluctant to adopt a national ideology, but it seems that for Putin, the time has come for a new Russian ideology for Russia and the world.*Anna Mahjar Barducci is Director of the MEMRI Russian Media Studies Project.APPENDIX - Russian President Vladimir Putin's Speech At The Plenary Session Of The 18th Annual Meeting Of The Valdai International Discussion Club Below are excerpts from Putin's speech at the Valdai Forum on October 21, 2021:[12] 'It Is Necessary To Fight For Real Values' ""... In general, this phrase, 'to live in an era of great change,' may seem trite since we use it so often. Also, this era of change began quite a long time ago, and changes have become part of everyday life. Hence, the question: are they worth focusing on? I agree with those who made the agenda for these meetings; of course they are. ""In recent decades, many people have cited a Chinese proverb. The Chinese people are wise, and they have many thinkers and valuable thoughts that we can still use today. One of them, as you may know, says, 'God forbid living in a time of change.' But we are already living in it, whether we like it or not, and these changes are becoming deeper and more fundamental. But let us consider another Chinese wisdom: the word 'crisis' consists of two hieroglyphs - there are probably representatives of the People's Republic of China in the audience, and they will correct me if I have it wrong - but, two hieroglyphs, 'danger' and 'opportunity.' And as we say here in Russia, 'fight difficulties with your mind, and fight dangers with your experience.' ""Of course, we must be aware of the danger and be ready to counter it, and not just one threat but many diverse threats that can arise in this era of change. However, it is no less important to recall a second component of the crisis - opportunities that must not be missed, all the more so since the crisis we are facing is conceptual and even civilization-related. This is basically a crisis of approaches and principles that determine the very existence of humans on Earth, but we will have to seriously revise them in any event. The question is where to move, what to give up, what to revise or adjust. In saying this, I am convinced that it is necessary to fight for real values, upholding them in every way. ""Humanity entered into a new era about three decades ago when the main conditions were created for ending military-political and ideological confrontation. I am sure you have talked a lot about this in this discussion club. Our Foreign Minister also talked about it, but nevertheless I would like to repeat several things. ""A search for a new balance, sustainable relations in the social, political, economic, cultural and military areas and support for the world system was launched at that time. We were looking for this support but must say that we did not find it, at least so far. Meanwhile, those who felt like the winners after the end of the Cold War (we have also spoken about this many times) and thought they climbed Mount Olympus soon discovered that the ground was falling away underneath even there, and this time it was their turn, and nobody could 'stop this fleeting moment' no matter how fair it seemed. ""In general, it must have seemed that we adjusted to this continuous inconstancy, unpredictability and permanent state of transition, but this did not happen either. ""I would like to add that the transformation that we are seeing and are part of is of a different caliber than the changes that repeatedly occurred in human history, at least those we know about. This is not simply a shift in the balance of forces or scientific and technological breakthroughs, though both are also taking place. Today, we are facing systemic changes in all directions - from the increasingly complicated geophysical condition of our planet to a more paradoxical interpretation of what a human is and what the reasons for his existence are. 'The Pandemic... Has Become A Divisive Rather Than A Unifying Factor' ""Let us look around. And I will say this again: I will allow myself to express a few thoughts that I sign on to. ""Firstly, climate change and environmental degradation are so obvious that even the most careless people can no longer dismiss them. One can continue to engage in scientific debates about the mechanisms behind the ongoing processes, but it is impossible to deny that these processes are getting worse, and something needs to be done. Natural disasters such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, and tsunamis have almost become the new normal, and we are getting used to them. Suffice it to recall the devastating, tragic floods in Europe last summer, the fires in Siberia - there are a lot of examples. Not only in Siberia - our neighbors in Turkey have also had wildfires, and the United States, and other places on the American continent. It sometimes seems that any geopolitical, scientific and technical, or ideological rivalry becomes pointless in this context, if the winners will have not enough air to breathe or nothing to drink. ""The coronavirus pandemic has become another reminder of how fragile our community is, how vulnerable it is, and our most important task is to ensure humanity a safe existence and resilience. To increase our chance of survival in the face of cataclysms, we absolutely need to rethink how we go about our lives, how we run our households, how cities develop or how they should develop; we need to reconsider economic development priorities of entire states. I repeat, safety is one of our main imperatives, in any case it has become obvious now, and anyone who tries to deny this will have to later explain why they were wrong and why they were unprepared for the crises and shocks whole nations are facing. ""Second. The socioeconomic problems facing humankind have worsened to the point where, in the past, they would trigger worldwide shocks, such as world wars or bloody social cataclysms. Everyone is saying that the current model of capitalism which underlies the social structure in the overwhelming majority of countries, has run its course and no longer offers a solution to a host of increasingly tangled differences. ""Everywhere, even in the richest countries and regions, the uneven distribution of material wealth has exacerbated inequality, primarily, inequality of opportunities both within individual societies and at the international level. I mentioned this formidable challenge in my remarks at the Davos Forum earlier this year. No doubt, these problems threaten us with major and deep social divisions. ""Furthermore, a number of countries and even entire regions are regularly hit by food crises. We will probably discuss this later, but there is every reason to believe that this crisis will become worse in the near future and may reach extreme forms. There are also shortages of water and electricity (we will probably cover this today as well), not to mention poverty, high unemployment rates or lack of adequate healthcare. ""Lagging countries are fully aware of that and are losing faith in the prospects of ever catching up with the leaders. Disappointment spurs aggression and pushes people to join the ranks of extremists. People in these countries have a growing sense of unfulfilled and failed expectations and the lack of any opportunities not only for themselves, but for their children, as well. This is what makes them look for better lives and results in uncontrolled migration, which, in turn, creates fertile ground for social discontent in more prosperous countries. I do not need to explain anything to you, since you can see everything with your own eyes and are, probably, versed on these matters even better than I. ""As I noted earlier, prosperous leading powers have other pressing social problems, challenges and risks in ample supply, and many among them are no longer interested in fighting for influence since, as they say, they already have enough on their plates. The fact that society and young people in many countries have overreacted in a harsh and even aggressive manner to measures to combat the coronavirus showed - and I want to emphasize this, I hope someone has already mentioned this before me at other venues - so, I think that this reaction showed that the pandemic was just a pretext: the causes for social irritation and frustration run much deeper. ""I have another important point to make. The pandemic, which, in theory, was supposed to rally the people in the fight against this massive common threat, has instead become a divisive rather than a unifying factor. There are many reasons for that, but one of the main ones is that they started looking for solutions to problems among the usual approaches - a variety of them, but still the old ones, but they just do not work. Or, to be more precise, they do work, but often and oddly enough, they worsen the existing state of affairs. 'Where Are The Humanitarian Fundamentals Of Western Political Thought?' ""By the way, Russia has repeatedly called for, and I will repeat this, stopping these inappropriate ambitions and for working together. We will probably talk about this later but it is clear what I have in mind. We are talking about the need to counter the coronavirus infection together. But nothing changes; everything remains the same despite the humanitarian considerations. I am not referring to Russia now, let's leave the sanctions against Russia for now; I mean the sanctions that remain in place against those states that badly need international assistance. Where are the humanitarian fundamentals of Western political thought? It appears there is nothing there, just idle talk. Do you understand? This is what seems to be on the surface. ""Furthermore, the technological revolution, impressive achievements in artificial intelligence, electronics, communications, genetics, bioengineering, and medicine open up enormous opportunities, but at the same time, in practical terms, they raise philosophical, moral and spiritual questions that were until recently the exclusive domain of science fiction writers. What will happen if machines surpass humans in the ability to think? Where is the limit of interference in the human body beyond which a person ceases being himself and turns into some other entity? What are the general ethical limits in the world where the potential of science and machines are becoming almost boundless? What will this mean for each of us, for our descendants, our nearest descendants - our children and grandchildren? ""These changes are gaining momentum, and they certainly cannot be stopped because they are objective as a rule. All of us will have to deal with the consequences regardless of our political systems, economic condition or prevailing ideology. ""Verbally, all states talk about their commitment to the ideals of cooperation and a willingness to work together for resolving common problems but, unfortunately, these are just words. In reality, the opposite is happening, and the pandemic has served to fuel the negative trends that emerged long ago and are now only getting worse. The approach based on the proverb, 'your own shirt is closer to the body,' has finally become common and is now no longer even concealed. Moreover, this is often even a matter of boasting and brandishing. Egotistic interests prevail over the notion of the common good. ""Of course, the problem is not just the ill will of certain states and notorious elites. It is more complicated than that, in my opinion. In general, life is seldom divided into black and white. Every government, every leader is primarily responsible to his own compatriots, obviously. The main goal is to ensure their security, peace and prosperity. So, international, transnational issues will never be as important for a national leadership as domestic stability. In general, this is normal and correct. ""We need to face the fact the global governance institutions are not always effective and their capabilities are not always up to the challenge posed by the dynamics of global processes. In this sense, the pandemic could help - it clearly showed which institutions have what it takes and which need fine-tuning. ""The re-alignment of the balance of power presupposes a redistribution of shares in favor of rising and developing countries that until now felt left out. To put it bluntly, the Western domination of international affairs, which began several centuries ago and, for a short period, was almost absolute in the late 20th century, is giving way to a much more diverse system. ""This transformation is not a mechanical process and, in its own way, one might even say, is unparalleled. Arguably, political history has no examples of a stable world order being established without a big war and its outcomes as the basis, as was the case after World War II. So, we have a chance to create an extremely favorable precedent. The attempt to create it after the end of the Cold War on the basis of Western domination failed, as we see. The current state of international affairs is a product of that very failure, and we must learn from this. ""Some may wonder, what have we arrived at? We have arrived somewhere paradoxical. Just an example: for two decades, the most powerful nation in the world has been conducting military campaigns in two countries that it cannot be compared to by any standard. But in the end, it had to wind down operations without achieving a single goal that it had set for itself going in 20 years ago, and to withdraw from these countries causing considerable damage to others and itself. In fact, the situation has worsened dramatically. ""But that is not the point. Previously, a war lost by one side meant victory for the other side, which took responsibility for what was happening. For example, the defeat of the United States in the Vietnam War, for example, did not make Vietnam a 'black hole.' On the contrary, a successfully developing state arose there, which, admittedly, relied on the support of a strong ally. Things are different now: no matter who takes the upper hand, the war does not stop, but just changes form. As a rule, the hypothetical winner is reluctant or unable to ensure peaceful post-war recovery, and only worsens the chaos and the vacuum posing a danger to the world. 'Values Are... A Unique Product Of Cultural And Historical Development Of Any Nation' ""Colleagues, ""What do you think are the starting points of this complex realignment process? Let me try to summarize the talking points. ""First, the coronavirus pandemic has clearly shown that the international order is structured around nation states. By the way, recent developments have shown that global digital platforms - with all their might, which we could see from the internal political processes in the United States - have failed to usurp political or state functions. These attempts proved ephemeral. The U.S. authorities, as I said, have immediately put the owners of these platforms in their place, which is exactly what is being done in Europe, if you just look at the size of the fines imposed on them and the demonopolization measures being taken. You are aware of that. ""In recent decades, many have tossed around fancy concepts claiming that the role of the state was outdated and outgoing. Globalization supposedly made national borders an anachronism, and sovereignty an obstacle to prosperity. You know, I said it before and I will say it again. This is also what was said by those who attempted to open up other countries' borders for the benefit of their own competitive advantages. This is what actually happened. And as soon as it transpired that someone somewhere is achieving great results, they immediately returned to closing borders in general and, first of all, their own customs borders and what have you, and started building walls. Well, were we supposed to not notice, or what? Everyone sees everything and everyone understands everything perfectly well. Of course, they do. ""There is no point in disputing it anymore. It is obvious. But events, when we spoke about the need to open up borders, events, as I said, went in the opposite direction. Only sovereign states can effectively respond to the challenges of the times and the demands of the citizens. Accordingly, any effective international order should take into account the interests and capabilities of the state and proceed on that basis, and not try to prove that they should not exist. Furthermore, it is impossible to impose anything on anyone, be it the principles underlying the sociopolitical structure or values that someone, for their own reasons, has called universal. After all, it is clear that when a real crisis strikes, there is only one universal value left and that is human life, which each state decides for itself how best to protect based on its abilities, culture and traditions. ""In this regard, I will again note how severe and dangerous the coronavirus pandemic has become. As we know, more than 4.9 million have died of it. These terrifying figures are comparable and even exceed the military losses of the main participants in World War I. ""The second point I would like to draw your attention to is the scale of change that forces us to act extremely cautiously, if only for reasons of self-preservation. The state and society must not respond radically to qualitative shifts in technology, dramatic environmental changes or the destruction of traditional systems. It is easier to destroy than to create, as we all know. We in Russia know this very well, regrettably, from our own experience, which we have had several times. ""Just over a century ago, Russia objectively faced serious problems, including because of the ongoing World War I, but its problems were not bigger and possibly even smaller or not as acute as the problems the other countries faced, and Russia could have dealt with its problems gradually and in a civilized manner. But revolutionary shocks led to the collapse and disintegration of a great power. The second time this happened 30 years ago, when a potentially very powerful nation failed to enter the path of urgently needed, flexible but thoroughly substantiated reforms at the right time, and as a result it fell victim to all kinds of dogmatists, both reactionary ones and the so-called progressives - all of them did their bit, all sides did. ""These examples from our history allow us to say that revolutions are not a way to settle a crisis but a way to aggravate it. No revolution was worth the damage it did to the human potential. ""Third. The importance of a solid support in the sphere of morals, ethics and values is increasing dramatically in the modern fragile world. In point of fact, values are a product, a unique product of cultural and historical development of any nation. The mutual interlacing of nations definitely enriches them, openness expands their horizons and allows them to take a fresh look at their own traditions. But the process must be organic, and it can never be rapid. Any alien elements will be rejected anyway, possibly bluntly. Any attempts to force one's values on others with an uncertain and unpredictable outcome can only further complicate a dramatic situation and usually produce the opposite reaction and an opposite from the intended result. 'We Will Be Guided By A Healthy Conservatism' ""We look in amazement at the processes underway in the countries which have been traditionally looked at as the standard-bearers of progress. Of course, the social and cultural shocks that are taking place in the United States and Western Europe are none of our business; we are keeping out of this. Some people in the West believe that an aggressive elimination of entire pages from their own history, 'reverse discrimination' against the majority in the interests of a minority, and the demand to give up the traditional notions of mother, father, family and even gender, they believe that all of these are the mileposts on the path towards social renewal. ""Listen, I would like to point out once again that they have a right to do this, we are keeping out of this. But we would like to ask them to keep out of our business as well. We have a different viewpoint, at least the overwhelming majority of Russian society - it would be more correct to put it this way - has a different opinion on this matter. We believe that we must rely on our own spiritual values, our historical tradition and the culture of our multiethnic nation. ""The advocates of so-called 'social progress' believe they are introducing humanity to some kind of a new and better consciousness. Godspeed, hoist the flags as we say, go right ahead. The only thing that I want to say now is that their prescriptions are not new at all. It may come as a surprise to some people, but Russia has been there already. After the 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks, relying on the dogmas of Marx and Engels, also said that they would change existing ways and customs and not just political and economic ones, but the very notion of human morality and the foundations of a healthy society. The destruction of age-old values, religion and relations between people, up to and including the total rejection of family (we had that, too), encouragement to inform on loved ones - all this was proclaimed progress and, by the way, was widely supported around the world back then and was quite fashionable, same as today. By the way, the Bolsheviks were absolutely intolerant of opinions other than theirs. ""This, I believe, should call to mind some of what we are witnessing now. Looking at what is happening in a number of Western countries, we are amazed to see the domestic practices, which we, fortunately, have left, I hope, in the distant past. The fight for equality and against discrimination has turned into aggressive dogmatism bordering on absurdity, when the works of the great authors of the past - such as Shakespeare - are no longer taught at schools or universities, because their ideas are believed to be backward. The classics are declared backward and ignorant of the importance of gender or race. In Hollywood memos are distributed about proper storytelling and how many characters of what color or gender should be in a movie. This is even worse than the agitprop department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. ""Countering acts of racism is a necessary and noble cause, but the new 'cancel culture' has turned it into 'reverse discrimination' that is, reverse racism. The obsessive emphasis on race is further dividing people, when the real fighters for civil rights dreamed precisely about erasing differences and refusing to divide people by skin color. I specifically asked my colleagues to find the following quote from Martin Luther King: 'I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.' This is the true value. However, things are turning out differently there. By the way, the absolute majority of Russian people do not think that the color of a person's skin or their gender is an important matter. Each of us is a human being. This is what matters. ""In a number of Western countries, the debate over men's and women's rights has turned into a perfect phantasmagoria. Look, beware of going where the Bolsheviks once planned to go - not only communalizing chickens, but also communalizing women. One more step and you will be there. ""Zealots of these new approaches even go so far as to want to abolish these concepts altogether. Anyone who dares mention that men and women actually exist, which is a biological fact, risk being ostracized. 'Parent number one' and 'parent number two,' 'birthing parent' instead of 'mother,' and 'human milk' replacing 'breastmilk' because it might upset the people who are unsure about their own gender. I repeat, this is nothing new; in the 1920s, the so-called Soviet Kulturtraegers also invented some newspeak believing they were creating a new consciousness and changing values that way. And, as I have already said, they made such a mess it still makes one shudder at times. ""Not to mention some truly monstrous things when children are taught from an early age that a boy can easily become a girl and vice versa. That is, the teachers actually impose on them a choice we all supposedly have. They do so while shutting the parents out of the process and forcing the child to make decisions that can upend their entire life. They do not even bother to consult with child psychologists - is a child at this age even capable of making a decision of this kind? Calling a spade a spade, this verges on a crime against humanity, and it is being done in the name and under the banner of progress. ""Well, if someone likes this, let them do it. I have already mentioned that, in shaping our approaches, we will be guided by a healthy conservatism. That was a few years ago, when passions on the international arena were not yet running as high as they are now, although, of course, we can say that clouds were gathering even then. Now, when the world is going through a structural disruption, the importance of reasonable conservatism as the foundation for a political course has skyrocketed - precisely because of the multiplying risks and dangers, and the fragility of the reality around us. ""This conservative approach is not about an ignorant traditionalism, a fear of change or a restraining game, much less about withdrawing into our own shell. It is primarily about reliance on a time-tested tradition, the preservation and growth of the population, a realistic assessment of oneself and others, a precise alignment of priorities, a correlation of necessity and possibility, a prudent formulation of goals, and a fundamental rejection of extremism as a method. And frankly, in the impending period of global reconstruction, which may take quite long, with its final design being uncertain, moderate conservatism is the most reasonable line of conduct, as far as I see it. It will inevitably change at some point, but so far, do no harm - the guiding principle in medicine - seems to be the most rational one. Noli nocere, as they say. ""Again, for us in Russia, these are not some speculative postulates, but lessons from our difficult and sometimes tragic history. The cost of ill-conceived social experiments is sometimes beyond estimation. Such actions can destroy not only the material, but also the spiritual foundations of human existence, leaving behind moral wreckage where nothing can be built to replace it for a long time. 'We Are Searching For Answers To The Most Urgent Challenges Of Our Time' ""Finally, there is one more point I want to make. We understand all too well that resolving many urgent problems the world has been facing would be impossible without close international cooperation. However, we need to be realistic: most of the pretty slogans about coming up with global solutions to global problems that we have been hearing since the late 20th century will never become reality. In order to achieve a global solution, states and people have to transfer their sovereign rights to supra-national structures to an extent that few, if any, would accept. This is primarily attributable to the fact that you have to answer for the outcomes of such policies not to some global public, but to your citizens and voters. ""However, this does not mean that exercising some restraint for the sake of bringing about solutions to global challenges is impossible. After all, a global challenge is a challenge for all of us together, and to each of us in particular. If everyone saw a way to benefit from cooperation in overcoming these challenges, this would definitely leave us better equipped to work together. ""One of the ways to promote these efforts could be, for example, to draw up, at the UN level, a list of challenges and threats that specific countries face, with details of how they could affect other countries. This effort could involve experts from various countries and academic fields, including you, my colleagues. We believe that developing a roadmap of this kind could inspire many countries to see global issues in a new light and understand how cooperation could be beneficial for them. ""I have already mentioned the challenges international institutions are facing. Unfortunately, this is an obvious fact: it is now a question of reforming or closing some of them. However, the United Nations as the central international institution retains its enduring value, at least for now. I believe that in our turbulent world it is the UN that brings a touch of reasonable conservatism into international relations, something that is so important for normalizing the situation. ""Many criticize the UN for failing to adapt to a rapidly changing world. In part, this is true, but it is not the UN, but primarily its members who are to blame for this. In addition, this international body promotes not only international norms, but also the rule-making spirit, which is based on the principles of equality and maximum consideration for everyone's opinions. Our mission is to preserve this heritage while reforming the organization. However, in doing so we need to make sure that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the saying goes. ""This is not the first time I am using a high rostrum to make this call for collective action in order to face up to the problems that continue to pile up and become more acute. It is thanks to you, friends and colleagues, that the Valdai Club is emerging or has already established itself as a high-profile forum. It is for this reason that I am turning to this platform to reaffirm our readiness to work together on addressing the most urgent problems that the world is facing today. ""Friends, ""The changes mentioned here prior to me, as well as by yours truly, are relevant to all countries and peoples. Russia, of course, is not an exception. Just like everyone else, we are searching for answers to the most urgent challenges of our time. ""Of course, no one has any ready-made recipes. However, I would venture to say that our country has an advantage. Let me explain what this advantage is. It is to do with our historical experience. You may have noticed that I have referred to it several times in the course of my remarks. Unfortunately, we had to bring back many sad memories, but at least our society has developed what they now refer to as herd immunity to extremism that paves the way to upheavals and socioeconomic cataclysms. People really value stability and being able to live normal lives and to prosper while confident that the irresponsible aspirations of yet another group of revolutionaries will not upend their plans and aspirations. Many have vivid memories of what happened 30 years ago and all the pain it took to climb out of the ditch where our country and our society found themselves after the USSR fell apart. ""The conservative views we hold are an optimistic conservatism, which is what matters the most. We believe stable, positive development to be possible. It all depends primarily on our own efforts. Of course, we are ready to work with our partners on common noble causes. ""I would like to thank all participants once more, for your attention. As the tradition goes, I will gladly answer or at least try to answer your questions. ""Thank you for your patience."" Notes: [1] En.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66975/print, October 21, 2021.

The idea of forcing people into their homes and not letting them leave for almost any reason stems from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, said Owen Shroyer of InfoWars. “That’s to set the precedent that if there’s a dangerous virus, that you shut down society,” he said. “Once that precedent is accepted, then they’re going to decide that you, the human, are the virus, so that then you’ll accept the lockdowns because of the human virus causing man-made climate change.” (Related: This is happening in the Australian province of South Australia, which had just elected a left-leaning government under the Australian Labor Party. Immediately following the election, newly elected Premier Peter Malinauskas “Declaring an emergency is what tyrants do when they wish to shut down debate, silence their opponents and ram through legislation that would otherwise be difficult to pass,” wrote journalist Lincoln Brown for the Spectator Australia . “South Australia’s opposition leader, David Speirs, dismissed Labor’s motion as mere virtue-signaling, but, while it is certainly virtue-signaling, it is more concerning than that.” Brown warned that the climate emergency is just the start. It will be followed by climate lockdowns, carbon footprint tracking and restrictions on personal fuel use and meat consumption. “[They] might sound like conspiracy theories now, but the stage is being set for them to appear in the near future,” said Brown. “As historian Dr. Stephen Chavura noted in response to Labor’s motion, ‘Emergency is the language that you use when democracy is no longer for you.'” Scientists oppose climate lockdown, say it won’t save the environment. Multiple international organizations have also been pushing for climate lockdowns recently, motivated no doubt by the success of COVID-19 lockdowns all over the world. This includes the United Nations Environment Program, which has called for climate lockdowns to cut carbon emissions by 7.6 percent every year for the next decade. But a group of Canadian scientists known as the Friends of Science Society recently came out in opposition to climate lockdowns. The group noted that even if climate change is real, lockdowns would do nothing to stop it and will only destroy people’s lives. “The fact is the drop in emissions during COVID lockdowns is not enough to significantly affect the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere,” read an open letter written by the Friends of Science addressed to the Bank of Canada. “One must compare the change of emissions to the annual change of CO2 concentrations, not to the cumulative CO2.” “Furthermore, carbon dioxide has never been empirically shown to be the main driver of climate change,” the letter further stated. “There has been no global change in extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, storms or hurricanes.” Learn the truth about the so-called climate change at Watch this clip from InfoWars as host Owen Shroyer talks to Evelyn Rae about the climate emergency in Australia and",South Australia declares climate emergency in preparation for coming climate lockdowns

Because of cut-off stocks from Ukrainian ports, which once exported large amounts of cereals as well as cooking oils, the global supply has diminished and prices of alternatives are skyrocketing. Globally, they are now nearly 30 percent higher than at the same time last year, according to the UN.Speaking at a UN security council meeting in New York on Wednesday, Mr Guterres said the Russian war ""threatens to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine"". The effects of climate change and the coronavirus pandemic, he added, have contributed to the emergency, too. In line with the UN's bleak assessment, Ms Stoyanova said: ""You already have a refugee crisis in Europe with people fleeing there from this war in Ukraine. Speaking to the Telegraph, she added: ""You may now get a refugee crisis from hunger in third countries too.""As per UN figures, around 20 million tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukraine from the previous harvest which, if released, could relieve pressure on global markets. Mr Guterres said the only effective solution to the food crisis was reintroducing Ukraine's food production, as well as fertiliser produced by both Russia and Belarus, back into global trading. He stressed: ""There is enough food in our world now if we act together. But unless we solve this problem today, we face the spectre of global food shortage in the coming months."" US secretary of state Antony Blinken, speaking at the meeting on Thursday, called on the Kremlin to ""stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression"". DON'T MISS [EXPLAINER] [ANALYSIS] [INSIGHT]Demanding Moscow lift its blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports, he said: ""The Russian government seems to think that using food as a weapon will help accomplish what its invasion has not to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people. ""The food supply for millions of Ukrainians and millions more around the world has quite literally been held hostage by the Russian military."" Earlier that day, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who now serves as a senior security official, warned Russia would not enable food supplies unless the West eased its sanctions on the country. Medvedev said Russia was ready to contribute to averting possible famine in some nations but expected ""assistance from trading partners, including on international platforms"" in return.He wrote on Telegram: ""Otherwise, there's no logic: on the one hand, insane sanctions are being imposed against us, on the other hand, they are demanding food supplies. ""Things don't work like that, we're not idiots. ""Countries importing our wheat and other food products will have a very difficult time without supplies from Russia. And on European and other fields, without our fertilisers, only juicy weeds will grow."" Medvedev, who headed the country between 2008 and 2012 and is now deputy chairman of Russia's security council, added: ""We have every opportunity to ensure that other countries have food, and food crises do not happen.

According to the USDA, the move is to foster a “more diverse and resilient local food system to empower communities to address issues like nutrition access and climate change.” But those who have been following the USDA closely for years know that they couldn’t care less about your health and nutrition. To register your garden with the USDA, one must meet several easily obtainable standards. School gardens, community gardens, urban farms, and small-scale agriculture projects in rural, suburban and urban areas can be recognized as a “People’s Garden” if they register on the USDA website and meet criteria including benefitting the community, working collaboratively, incorporating conservation practices and educating the public.",US Department of Agriculture Now Asking People to ...

The arrival of the imperialist alliance on Russia’s doorstep prompted Russia’s incursion into Ukraine. With the ultimate goal of subjugating Russia, NATO is war-gaming every approach to Russian territory. In the largest military exercise led by NATO ally Norway in a generation, last week NATO finished a live-fire rehearsal for war on Russia’s northern flank, the High Arctic exercise dubbed Cold Response 2022. The significance of such large-scale NATO exercises is underscored by the escalating conflict in Ukraine. As Russia desperately seeks to counter the spread of NATO influence over its neighbor with its reactionary invasion of that country, putting NATO military exercises into practice becomes an immediate possibility. Cold Response took place as the world powers tangle on the brink of World War III.U.S. Marines inspect a MV-22B Osprey prior to flight at Norwegian Air Force Base Bodo during Exercise Cold Response 22, Norway, March 16, 2022. (Lance Cpl. Elias E. Pimentel III/U.S. Marine Corps via AP) Cold Response is a biannual display of martial might that has grown with the immediacy of NATO war plans. “We invite this exercise mainly within a NATO framework, and the size of it all depends on the interest from our allies and partners,” Norwegian military spokesman Preben Aursand told High North News , before the maneuver. With the US and NATO considering direct conflict with Russia over Ukraine, the “interest” in preparing the northern theater is running especially high, and Cold Response has scaled up accordingly, more than doubling in size since 2020. The objective of the large-scale military maneuver is to prepare to engage militarily with Russia on the sea, land and air in the Arctic environment. Approximately 30,000 troops from 27 countries—including 3,000 US Marines and 1,000 German “Bundeswehr” soldiers —along with 220 aircraft and 50 vessels converged on the north of Norway. The first phase of Cold Response was a maritime “access and denial” operation, which amounts in practical terms to a blockade of Russian military and commercial vessels from accessing the Atlantic Ocean from the northern cold-water port of Arkhangelsk, as well as to assuring that NATO warships can reach the Barents Sea off Russia’s northern coast, where US and UK ships resumed patrols in 2020 after an absence since the 1980s.The tremendous presentation of NATO sea power in these waters so critical to Russia included aircraft carrier strike groups from the UK and Italy, lead by the HMS Prince of Wales. A third carrier strike group lead by the USS Harry S. Truman was scheduled to participate, having just completed exercise Neptune Strike 2022, but extended its deployment in the Mediterranean to “reassure allies” as the war in Ukraine escalates. Intensive air operations, including the deployment of carrier-based air power, in the second phase of Cold Response served to prepare for amphibious invasion simulations in the third phase. Thousands of NATO troops have been congregating in Norway since last fall to practice assaults on costal population centers. Invariably presented as a defensive exercise to “restore national integrity,” these operations need only be shifted a little eastward along the northern Norwegian coast to become a real attack on the Russian north. Russia’s Northern Fleet, armed with nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles, makes berth in Murmansk, less than 150km from the Norwegian border. Significantly, officials and commentators were increasingly dispensing with the pretense of the supposedly “defensive” nature of these military exercises. “I think this exercise is a good counterpart, a good companion to the ongoing reinforcement of the (alliance’s) eastern flank that has been taking place since Russia’s invasion began,” said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Cold Response 2022 also marked the culmination of Operation Brilliant Jump, the exercise and a certification of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, NATO’s vanguard, all-theater rapid reaction force. Brilliant Jump, involving 2,500 troops, 10 warships and 750 sailors, began in Norway last February. Once certified, these elite units are deployable within five days to any NATO theater, including the High North. While Moscow declined an invitation to formally observe the exercise, Russian warships patrolled at a distance. As large as Cold Response is, it threatens primarily the northern approach to Russia. In imperialism’s encirclement of its geopolitical rival, however, NATO conducts a host of massive military exercises along Russia’s western and southern flanks. The massive Steadfast Defender 2020 exercise war-gamed the approach to Russia from northern Europe while Steadfast Defender 2021 practiced the approach from the south, preparing for combat in the Balkans and Black Sea Region. War games on the Black Sea itself were staged in, like Cold Response, war-gamed the far north in 2018. The list goes on. The eastward expansion of NATO beginning after the fall of the Soviet Union has steadily crossed Eastern Europe, absorbing the post WWII “buffer states” and reaching Russia’s boarder in the Baltic in 2004. In 2014, a Western-orchestrated right-wing coup in theretofore Russia-aligned Ukraine installed a pro-western government deep in Russia’s side. That Russia retained control of Crimea, which hosts Russia’s Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol, was considered a military imperative as NATO spread its sphere of influence over Russia’s strategically important neighbor. Russia responded to NATO’s continued arming and training of anti-Russian elements within Ukraine—the Ukrainian army, led by a pro-Western government, as well as neo-Nazi paramilitary groups like the Azov Battalion—by launching its military attack at the end of February. Western cries of “Russian aggression” in an “unprovoked invasion” serve only as political cover while NATO pushes eastward with the ultimate aim of removing Russia as an obstacle to a global “rules-based order,” that is, US political and economic domination. Whether by instigating a regime change, inciting internal divisions or by direct military confrontation, imperialism, driven by nation-based capitalism’s demand for control of global markets and resources, considers it “in its interest” to subjugate by whatever means its Russian, and for that matter Chinese, rival. Without defending the reactionary Putin regime of oligarchs and kleptocrats, it is NATO, not Russia, who is the aggressor. Beyond the immediate confrontation with Russia, heightened interest in the Arctic, embodied by Cold Response and the even larger Trident Juncture in 2018, is driven by what capitalist governments perceive as “opportunities” as manmade climate change causes sea ice to retreat. The shortened shipping routes with the opening of the Northwest and Northeast Passages are viewed not as a manifest catastrophe but as potentially lucrative for business, requiring military control in the “national interest” of Arctic nations. Mineral and fossil fuel deposits becoming accessible in Arctic regions likewise have world powers jostling to exploit them. It is an irredeemable indictment of capitalism that its response to the irrefutable consequences of climate change does not inspire an alarmed re-prioritization of resources to save the planet but rather renewed vigor in Because capitalist governments are incapable of resisting their interest in world domination to the point of risking full-scale war and the irreversible destabilization of whole ecosystems, it is entirely futile to appeal to these powers for peace or sustainable stewardship of the Earth. Only an independent, international movement of the working class can muster the social strength necessary to take the reigns of power from the capitalists and reorganize the world economy to stop war and meet the needs of humanity.",Cold Response 2022: NATO concludes war rehearsal on Russia’s northern flank

He made the remarks while delivering a speech via video at the opening ceremony of the 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP14). In his speech, Xi noted that it is important to build global consensus on prizing wetlands, show respect for nature, minimize disruption and damage caused by human activities, and protect the ecological security of wetlands in order to leave the beautiful wetlands to future generations. ""It is important that we advance the global process on wetlands conservation, redouble efforts to preserve authenticity and integrity, include more important wetlands in nature reserves, improve cooperation mechanisms and platforms, and increase the coverage of wetlands of international importance,"" Xi said. He also called for enhancing people's well-being globally by leveraging the role of wetlands in promoting sustainable development, tackling climate change, protecting biodiversity, and delivering more benefits to people around the world. Historic achievements have been made in wetlands conservation in China. The country has increased the area of wetlands to 56.35 million hectares, put in place a protection system and enacted a Wetlands Conservation Law, according to Xi. The president further noted that China will pursue a modernization of harmony between humanity and nature, and promote high-quality development in the wetlands conservation cause. China has recently drawn up a layout plan of national parks. Under the plan, China will designate a number of national parks, accounting for about 10 percent of the country's land area. About 11 million hectares of wetlands will be incorporated in the national park system, with a focus on developing wetland national parks including the Three-River-Source National Park, the Qinghai Lake National Park, the Ruoergai National Park, the Yellow River Estuary National Park, the Liao River Estuary National Park and the Songnen Plain Crane Homeland National Park.

Biden was in San Diego as part of a West Coast trip to fundraise for Democrats ahead of next week’s midterm elections. During a speech on Friday, the president reminisced about visiting a former coal power plant in Massachusetts, which had been repurposed to wind power generation. He said this happened because continuing to use coal was just too expensive presumably due to the costs imposed by government regulations. “We’re gonna be shutting these plants down all across America, and having wind and solar,” Biden told the audience.“CHIPS and Science Act” his government enacted in August. The bill set aside around $280 billion for domestic microchip manufacturing. According to Reuters, Biden’s trip to the manufacturing facility is “aimed at bolstering support for Democrats, who face a real risk of losing their razor-thin majorities in the US Congress.” California is a Democrat stronghold with little chance of an upset in the upcoming midterms, however. The president’s promise of putting coal miners and power-plant workers out of jobs backfired almost instantly, with the opposition Republicans sharing the clip on Twitter and other social media platforms. Biden has doubled down on the push to shut down industries that his government sees as contributing to global warming, pledging to cut US carbon emissions in half by 2030. This is proceeding regardless of his other stated goal of racial “equity.” Last month, Democrats running New Mexico closed down a coal mine and the nearby power plant, eliminating hundreds of jobs in the already impoverished Navajo country, AP",Biden promises to shutter US coal power plants

Appearing alongside WEF President Børge Brende and various corporate executives, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said that it is urgent for the private sector to pair with governments to realise the goal of preventing the global temperature from rising and to save lives in the allegedly looming global climate crisis. “We have an enormous challenge before us to bring to scale new technologies and to harness the deeply capable capacity of private sector entrepreneurs in order to bring them to the table because without it, no government has enough money… we need everybody behind this,” Kerry said in a speech before the panel. “The idea behind the launch of the First Movers Coalition is pretty straightforward, we needed to create demand signals in the market where they didn’t exist, which takes boldness, it takes courage from these executives who have made the decision to be a part of this. The First Movers Coalition was established ahead of last year’s COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in partnership between the U.S. State Department and Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum. The green project seeks to sign up private firms to commit to green agenda efforts to reduce carbon emissions. “We modelled it somewhat on the experience on what happened with vaccines, the government said ‘we’ll pay for it, build it,’ and the same thing with SpaceX, if you build it we are going to use it and we’ll pay for it. “People who were putting capital at risk knew that they could get a return on that capital or at least cover their expenses in the case of something like vaccines, where human life was so at risk. Well, human life is at risk now in the context of the challenges of the global climate crisis,” Kerry warned.","Kerry, Podesta, Macron: Technocrats Openly Hostile..."

With energy bills predicted to reach 3,000 by the end of the year, this couple have shared how they reduced their bills in hopes of helping other families do the same.The pair explained how they dramatically cut their home’s carbon footprint and energy consumption at an environmental event organised by the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA). Over a number of years, the couple had carried out an extensive insulation programme on their 1930s home which has eventually saved them thousands each year. Harriet and Chris installed other low carbon technology such as solar PV panels and energy saving lighting.They estimate the work is now saving them around 1,000 a year in fuel bills. Not only are they saving in fuel bills but they have managed to reduce their gas usage by 65 percent and electricity by 70 percent. The WMCA is now following the couple's example by putting in place a number of initiatives that will see similar retrofitting measures installed in hundreds more homes across the region in the months ahead.

Tribes living in the foothills of Africa’s tallest mountain expected ominous grey clouds to transform the unseasonable azure-coloured sky from the start of March but they are nowhere to be seen. Father of five Ndorkko, whose cattle is herded to green pastures further afield in search of water, told how rain falls later each year, or sometimes not at all. He said: “The environment around us is changing due to long droughts. Last year, we expected rain in early October but it didn’t rain until December. “It rained until mid-January this year and then it stopped suddenly. That’s not normal. It’s climate change. We expected rain from early March this year but that has not happened. “Livestock in some areas have died but not mine.” A trip of his goats heading to graze demanded our attention when they sent a cloud of red dust into the air while exiting their thorn-fenced boma a reminder of the bone-dry sand beneath their hooves. The Maa language rolling off Ndorkko’s tongue quickly entranced us again as he spoke about the parched land baking beneath our feet.While the dust settled around us, he said: “Drought is my biggest worry. We have lots of goats and cattle, so there will be no grass [without rain]. This will have a huge impact on us."" The challenge facing his youngest sons Tajiu, four, and Mami, six, is as tall as the world-famous mountain behind him. The boys will eventually inherit their father’s rungu, a traditional wooden throwing club used for herding, as well as a world blighted by human-induced climate change. For the Maasai and other pastoralists, a cow is not only used for sustenance; it also is an integral part of their culture. They have historically depended on cattle for meeting all of their basic needs: food, clothing, and shelter. The Maasai thrive on a steady diet of beef and cow's milk and use cattle bones and horns for knives, spoons, and bowls. As descendants of lion-slaughtering warriors, the tribe is taking on the climate threat in the same way their ancestors took on the King of the Savanna with a fierce fight. The pink and blue cloth, called a shuka, draped across Ndorkko’s shoulder falls to the side when he proudly points to one of the many trees he has planted to provide shade and help save the planet. Wildlife and conservation manager Daniel Sayianka, 28, and his colleagues at the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust (MWCT) work with Ndorkko and the community to help them adapt to the altering environment.We trekked across the jumble of ancient volcanic cones and craters to find a group of women restoring the barren landscape by digging thousands of semi-circular bunds. They are used to rehabilitate degraded and hardened land for crop growing. Pachacha Keteko and Nkunini Parari have helped create an oasis in an otherwise desolate surrounding by nurturing grass seed banks. When the grass has fully grown, the seeds are sold to other regreening projects and the grass is cut and bought by locals for animal grazing. Pachacha and Nkunini, who helped harvest 5.1 tonnes of grass seeds last year, said: “We are poor but MWCT has helped us through this project. We were employed to dig half-moon shapes and given seeds to plant then harvest. “We have now finished harvesting and we have sold the seeds to benefit other projects to help the environment. We also sell the grass to the community, and use the money to pay for our children’s school fees among other things.” To mitigate against climate change, MWCT has helped the Maasai diversify their income and build resilience by piloting bee-keeping and making beaded products to sell to tourists. But the Maasai are not the only part of the landscape at risk. Glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro's peak, immortalised in literature and film, could vanish within the next two decades, experts have warned.Its disappearing blanket of ice signals the threat of imminent and irreversible change to the Earth. Sayianka, who remembers more snow on the mountain as a boy, said: “The amount of ice there is reducing due to climate change. “In the past, it used to cover significantly more of the mountain’s slopes but it is reducing day by day”. Before turning our backs on the world’s highest free-standing mountain for Nairobi, I asked Ndorkko if he would teach me the adumu, the Maasai’s renowned celebratory “jumping dance”. Just feet away from the acacia tree where our morning began, he bent his knees and leapt into the air leaving the arid ground far beneath him. Despite the non-existent nimbus clouds and the battle for survival ahead, the resilient Maasai are still finding reasons to jump for joy. -Steph Spyro and Steve Reigate offset the greenhouse gases from their return flights to Kenya with C Level Earth.",Kenyan warrior tribe are facing their biggest enemy... climate change

The genesis of the current crisis, as BAP has previously asserted , is in the 2014 US-backed coup of Ukraine’s democratically elected government – and in the determination of the U.S./EU/NATO “axis of domination” to convert Ukraine into a heavily-militarized NATO member nation, lurking on the border of the Russian Federation. NATO’s expansion has been a well-known security concern for Russia since 1999, when Bill Clinton inaugurated the official process of growing NATO’s membership to include former nations of the Warsaw Pact. Today, as the conflict escalates, NATO’s expansion has become an existential threat to African people and all oppressed and colonized people around the world. For peace to arrive in the region and in the world, the expansion of this “axis of domination” must be halted and NATO must be dismantled.But what is peace? For BAP, peace is not merely the absence of conflict. Peace means the achievement, through popular struggle and self-defense, of a world liberated from militarism and nuclear proliferation, imperialism and unjust war, patriarchy, and white supremacy. Indeed, the resurgence and celebration of Nazism in the Ukraine, as well as in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, represents a global consolidation of white supremacy as part of the project of imperialism. This consolidation also appears through invocations of and appeals to white, “civilized” nations and peoples and the entrenchment of an unabashedly racist pan-European world. Peace also means dismantling a military-industrial complex that is clearly profiting from endless war and intervention and reinvesting bloated “defense” budgets into education, health and child care, housing, and the battle against global warming. We need to dismantle NATO for the same reasons we need to abolish the police: both serve the interests of capital and empire at the expense of the global working classes. The Black Alliance for Peace is mindful of the loss of life in Ukraine, but also in Somalia, Yemen, and every nation suffering under NATO wars of domination. We offer our unwavering solidarity with the people of these places. As BAP Coordinating Committee member Rafiki Morris argues: “Our concern for the people of Ukraine must be added to our overarching concern for those in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya; coups in Egypt, Honduras, Ukraine, Bolivia, Brazil; subversion in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba; coups across the African continent with soldiers trained by AFRICOM.” We note, for example, that as the U.S. condemned the military actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, its armed drones bombed Somalia. Moreover, as Black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean were abandoned and mistreated in the Ukraine, the 200th deportation flight of the Biden administration sent 129 Haitians to Port-au-Prince, adding to the 21,000 already deported in one year. To secure the interests of the Russian and Ukrainian people, there must be good faith negotiations between the Russian Federation, representatives of the peoples of Donbas, and the U.S. The EU and the U.S. must end their continuous shipments of arms and other “lethal aid” to Ukraine. Ukraine and Russia must enter into serious discussions with the peoples of the Donbas in order to determine if the Minsk agreement, which was unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council in 2015, is still applicable. And NATO must be disbanded. A cloud of confusion has settled on many people, as the lusty calls for war with Russia grow louder and the propagandistic appeals to patriotism, racial nationalism, and the defense of “white civilization” intensify. For BAP, there is no confusion. The conflict in the Ukraine has only exposed the hypocrisy and contradictions of imperialism, war, and militarism – and the demand for peace means to fight against U.S. imperialism and the U.S./EU/NATO axis of domination.

The comments were made by Baden-Württemberg’s Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann in response to the energy crisis, which will be exacerbated this winter as a result of gas shortages caused by the war in Ukraine.The pellet heating system Kretschmann uses in his home costs anything up to €21,000 euros and beyond, a figure completely unrealistic for Germans already struggling to pay their energy bills. Remix News explained the actual environmental cost of Kretschmann’s so-called solution. “Wired magazine reports that these devices rely primarily on wood pellets sourced from forests in the southeastern United States. They are then shipped halfway around the world to individuals like Kretschmann despite many scientists arguing that these pellets are just as polluting as coal.”“Although they come from a renewable resource, forests are cut down across the U.S. to make this resource, and according to Greenpeace, the practice destroys biodiversity and ruins entire ecosystems. Scientists estimate it takes between 44 to over 100 years for these forests to grow back, and for those worried about climate change, they say this destruction of natural forests will cost the planet immeasurably.”Unser Land steht vor einer Energiekrise, die den Wohlstand von Millionen Menschen bedroht!

Supplies of firewood and heating stoves are also being exhausted, while cities across Germany are planning to use sports arenas and exhibition halls as ‘warm up spaces’ this winter to help freezing citizens who are unable to afford skyrocketing energy costs. Germans have also been told to take fewer showers, wear more layers of clothing and avoid washing their clothes and driving their cars as often. As we reported last week, the interior minister of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Herbert Reul (CDU), outrageously suggested Germans who may be planning to protest against energy blackouts were “enemies of the state” and “extremists” who want to overthrow the government.

At a virtual event earlier this month hosted by the U.S. Energy Association, for example, Amy Andryszak, president and CEO of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, charged that FERC’s gas reviews had “slowed significantly.” “All of these send signals to the market that discourage domestic production of natural gas and domestic infrastructure investments,” Andryszak said during the event. In the case of Enhancement by Compression, further “delays” by FERC could jeopardize the reliability of the New York gas system, the utility companies each said in comments.“[This] Commission should recognize National Grid’s need to provide safe and adequate service. Given the particular facts of this proceeding i.e., a limited compression project that is needed to reliably serve customer demand the Commission should reject any attempt to delay issuance of the certificate,” National Grid wrote. Background. Iroquois Gas Transmission operates a natural gas pipeline system serving New York and Connecticut from Waddington on the St. Lawrence River to Hunts Point in New York City. Back in 2019, Iroquois proposed to enhance compression to increase natural gas deliveries by 125 MMcf/d to gas-needy areas by winter 2023/24. (Further information on the project can be found Buyers and seller have agreed to the project. That should have been enough for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve the project after cursory review. Application submitted, the project was ripe for approval in early 2021 and should be well under construction. But Biden was elected and energy further politicized.Additional capacity with no new pipeline; Reduction in life cycle GHG emissions and air pollution; Increased property tax revenue for host communities; Construction jobs and boost to local economy during construction; Project related Community Grants. In FERC’s draft Environmental Impact Statement issued in June 2021, FERC stated: Based on the environmental analysis in the EA and in this EIS, staff have determined that approval of the Project would not result in significant environmental impacts, with the exception of greenhouse gas emissions. Although we acknowledge the Project’s direct and downstream emissions would increase the atmospheric concentration of GHGs, in combination with past and future emissions from all other sources, and would contribute to climate change, we are unable to come to a conclusion regarding the significance of the Project’s contribution to climate change. In accordance with NEPA and Commission policy, we evaluated alternatives to the Project to determine whether they would be reasonable and environmentally preferable to the proposed action. These alternatives included the no-action alternative, system alternatives, fuel alternatives, and location alternatives for the proposed new facilities. Although all of the alternatives we evaluated appear to be technically feasible, none provide a significant environmental advantage over the Project design. Therefore, we conclude that the Project, as modified by our recommendations in section E of this EIS, is the preferred alternative to meet Project objectives. The old Federal Power Commission once hampered interstate natural gas transmission by giving standing to fuel oil and coal; FERC today is siding with anti-energy environmentalists that want less affordable, less reliable fossil fuels.Voter-citizens will have their say come this November and beyond.

12607,dailycaller-b451c56f8f305298e8c6d9705d7717a4,2022-10-15 01:27:00,"About 40 of the National Security Council’s (NSC) 250 officials nearly one in six are Obama administration holdovers, according to TheDCNF’s analysis. The holdovers include NSC directors for Korea, China, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Eastern Europe, Israel-Palestine, South America, North Africa and sub-Sahara Africa. Holdovers also advise on weapons of mass destruction, counterterrorism, non-proliferation, arms control, defense policy, immigration, and homeland preparedness. It’s been common practice in previous administrations to retain holdovers from an outgoing administration, and nearly all are on loan from other federal agencies. But current and former administration officials tell TheDCNF they are concerned that so many Obama era holdovers are still working at NSC eight months into the Trump administration. “The problem is the allegiance they have to their former administration and their position and stances on national security,” said Col. James Waurishuk (Ret.), a 30-year veteran senior intelligence official and a former NSC official. “It’s crazy when they represent pretty much 180 degrees of what Trump is trying to do.” Some blame McMaster for the holdovers. “He has protected and coddled them,” alleged one former NSC staffer who requested anonymity.Officials on the the NSC who support the president’s agenda are on edge since McMaster dismissed Trump faithfuls Ezra Cohen-Watnick, NSC senior director for intelligence, and Derek Harvey, NSC’s director for the Middle East. McMaster’s deputy, Maj. Gen. Rick Waddell, also fired Richard Higgins, NSC director for strategic planning. Among the NSC holdovers is Allison Hooker, an architect of former President Barack Obama’s Korean policy. She remains NSC director for Korea as Trump grapples with the worst crisis between the U.S. and North Korea since the 1953 truce that stopped the Korean War. Hooker joined the NSC as the director for Korea in 2014 after previously working at the Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research. She visited South Korea in September and December 2014 in a failed effort to restart the “six-party talks” North Korea canceled in April 2009, only three months after Obama took office. Hooker returned to South Korea earlier this year in advance of Trump’s fall visit to Asia. Trump sternly denounced Obama’s Korean policy in April. “The era of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed. Frankly, that patience is over,” he said in a Rose Garden press news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Another holdover is Fernando Cutz, McMaster’s director for South America who previously reported to former deputy NSC advisor Ben Rhodes, according to administration sources. Cutz enthusiastically endorsed Obama’s Cuba policy throughout his tenure as an NSC staffer. Cutz received his master’s degree in international relations from the Clinton School of Public Service, which operates on the grounds of the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark. On Feb. 2, 2011, Cutz moderated a Q&A session at the school by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He was the school’s class president and delivered the commencement speech in 2010. When Cutz was working to advance the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba, the Clinton School tweeted congratulations for his work on the issue.Trump has imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, including a freeze on President Nicolas Maduro’s assets, but he has yet to take aim at Cuba, Maduro’s main support. It’s unknown if Cutz would recommend retaliation against Cuba. Cuban leader Raul Castro is calling the shots in Venezuela where thousands of Cuban intelligence officials roam in the country, The Wall Street Journal’s Mary Anastasia O’Gradyin an Aug. 6, 2017, column. “Any U.S.-led international strategy to liberate Venezuela must begin with the explicit recognition that Cuba is calling the shots in Caracas,” O’Grady wrote. Andrea Hall, another top Obama holdover and former “direct report” to Rhodes, now serves as NSC’s senior director for weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and threat reduction. Hall’s primary research interest as a Ph.D. candidate in security studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2003 was nuclear weapons, particularly as they applied to Russia. A paper she wrote while earning her doctoral degree “Prospects for U.S: Russian Nonproliferation Cooperation Under Bush and Putin” provides a glimpse into Hall’s thinking about Russia. She blamed the West for hurting Russian leader Vladimir Putin. “Russia has received few tangible benefits from its cooperation with the United States,” Hall wrote. She claimed Washington was “ignoring Russian concerns.” “Given that Putin has received significant criticism for his foreign policy concessions and that he has valid concerns about the Russian economy, Washington would be wise to help Russia achieve some of its goals as well in order to cement this partnership,” she wrote. The Nuclear Threat Institute co-sponsored her paper, which MIT provided. Wealthy liberal donor Ted Turner founded the institute years prior, and former Georgia Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn co-chaired it. Rear Adm. David Kriete is another Obama holdover. He is now NSC’s director for strategic capabilities policy and responsible for policy on nuclear weapons-related issues. He was a representative to the interagency panel that wrote Obama’s 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, which reflected the former chief executive’s vision of a “nuclear-free world.” The review received withering criticism on the right, with National Review claiming it “undermines the basis of the deterrent policy that has helped maintain the peace for more than 60 years.” Jennifer Smith started as NSC’s director for Pakistan in March 2015, according to her LinkedIn page. Michael Anton, an NSC spokesman said her LinkedIn page is incorrect and she works on weapons of mass destruction. He did not explain, however, the discrepancy. From 2009 to 2011, she joined the Organization for the Prohibitions of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, which represents 192 signatories of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Smith later worked at the Cooperative Threat Reduction Oversight program established by Nunn and former Sen. Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican, to verify the destruction of Russian and U.S. nuclear weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin withdrew from the convention in 2012. Smith remained at the threat reduction office but switched to working on the Ebola virus. Her NSC Korean appointment followed thereafter. Jessica Cox, the former national coordinator for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark, is now the NSC’s Director for Arms Control. She was also previously client manager of Grassroots Enterprise, a PR company founded by John Hinko, who led the petition against former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment for Moveon.org that generated more than half a million signatures. Cox’s “specialties” at Grassroots included , “fundraising, grassroots organization particularly via the internet, building membership and activists.” Two NSC officials Stephani Morrisson and Heather King work on domestic emergency preparedness and appear to be passionate climate change advocates. Other NSC holdovers appear to be non-political, such as Joseph Gagliano, director for counterterrorism. A Gagliano paper on unconventional warfare was found in Osama bin Laden’s home after the military raid on his compound in Pakistan. Holdover Robert Wilson, a career military man, is also the director for counterterrorism. Wilson commanded a 2,400 member Special Forces group that fought in Afghanistan and oversaw special operations against the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Boko Harm. In an interview with TheDCNF, Anton called all the holdovers “stalwarts” who faithfully follow the president’s foreign and military policies.",EXCLUSIVE: McMaster Retains Obama Holdovers Who Led Initiatives At Odds With Trump

Steve Sapsford, consultant for Coryton , said more needed to be done to incentivise other options to reduce vehicle emissions. Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, he said: “For me, electrification for passenger cars is the right trajectory, that is what we should be doing in my view.“What I don’t quite understand is why we’re steadfastly ignoring the existing fleet.READ MORE: New parking driving laws could lead to chaos for drivers on car parks Petrol and diesel vehicles 'demonised' as experts call for more investments in biofuels.“There’s a lot of cars and we don’t have to switch everything to a sustainable fuel straight away. “Just do it in steps over a few years. Multiply up by the number of vehicles and you get some significant greenhouse gas savings. “But nobody is going to invest in that at the moment because we’ve demonised the internal combustion engine and burning things in engines. “We need to scale up to drive volumes up and prices down. DON'T MISS [ANALYSIS] [INSIGHT] [IMPORTANT]“But there is no incentive to do it. That’s what we’re trying to do, you can’t ignore what is going on now.” Coryton creates bespoke fuel solutions that can work with petrol and diesel vehicles to help with transition to net zero by 2050. The use of biofuels in the UK became a major topic last year when the Government announced unleaded petrol would be upgraded to E10 fuel. E10 was introduced to forecourts to aid with the push for net zero emissions, with it being “cleaner” and “greener” thanks to it being blended with up to 10 percent ethanol.It's Kwik Fits' Midsommer Madness sale and you can take 10% off your MOT Test with the UK's #1 MOT tester - just click the link to book online.The Government could cut transport CO2 emissions by 750,000 tonnes per year, which is the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off of UK roads. Mr Sapsford commented on the fuel change, saying: “It was certainly a step in the right direction. “One of the issues of going with more ethanol, particularly, is the backwards compatibility of systems. “Petrol engines made in the last few years could actually run with more ethanol than that, but vehicles older than that cannot really run with any more than 10 percent.“That really is the maximum you could do with the ethanol blend. “Yes, it helps and 10 percent of all the fuel sold saves a lot of greenhouse gas. “But you could go further, you just have to be a little bit smarter. “By adding renewable components, you can save 80 percent of the associated greenhouse gases that it replaces, if they are second generation biofuels for example.”",Petrol and diesel vehicles 'demonised' as experts call for more investments in biofuels MORE investment is needed into biofuels to help lower emissions despite petrol and...

Due to multiple crises which have afflicted Iraq since Daesh occupied Mosul and much of the north, the poverty rate has risen from 19 to 30 per cent. Unemployment and food insecurity are driving household and child poverty. Five years after Daesh was driven from its false “caliphate”, 1.2 million Iraqis remain in displacement camps, due to the destruction of their homeowns and villages, rejection by Iraqis now living there, and exclusion by Shiite militias in control of the areas where they once lived. Sweden’s International Development Cooperation Agency reports that the situation in Iraq has deteriorated dramatically because of “climate change, coupled with severe environmental degradation and mismanagement of natural resources”, creating “a very real danger for ecosystem collapse in Iraq, specifically threatening biodiversity, water and food security as well as long term stability.” The 2021-2022 drought has dried Iraq’s ancient rivers, agricultural production and turned the country into a dust bowl. The temperature is rising and heatwaves last longer. In August this year, Basra recorded a temperature of 51.8ºC, the highest in the world to date. Once considered the Venice of the region, Basra has long been afflicted with power cuts and water shortages, making it one of the most unliveable cities on earth. Compounding misery with illness, the BBC has revealed that communities living near the oil fields in Basra province are at risk of suffering leukaemia because the burning of gas released in oil drilling which emits pollutants that cause cancer. The BBC reports that British Petroleum and Italy’s multi-national ENI are the main firms present in the Basra area. The Iraqi health ministry blamed flaring for a 20 per cent increase in cancer between 2016-2018. Farmers interviewed by the BBC said they also have kidney disease and breathing problems. Children have been particularly susceptible but have not been offered compensation to provide them with health care. Iraq, of course, depends on these companies and has not raised legal cases. There are five major oil fields in Basra province. The largest, Rumaila is the chief polluter. When I was a child living in the US mid-west, Iraqi dates were an annual Christmas treat in our household. As far as I knew at that time, Iraq was the world’s main source of dates. Indeed, I later learned Iraq did export most of the dates reaching world markets. The war with Iran (1980-1988) and the 2003-2011 US occupation reduced by half Iraq’s 30 million date palms. Consequently, Iraqi date exports are only 5 per cent of global consumption. Shortage of water, disease, and lack of care have taken their toll among date palms although the trees are said to be making a comeback in leafy suburbs of Baghdad. The tall palms in the large garden of my friends, Suad, Selma, Nuha and Abbad al-Radi were ailing when I last visited the compound in 2004 and the Radis did not know if they could be saved. Perhaps they have. The date palm has been a symbol of Iraq long before oil rigs sprouted in its deserts. Oil-rich Iraq should be flourishing but is, instead, floundering on the edge of collapse thanks to internal disputes and the never-ending politico-military-economic interventions of Western and regional powers.

President Joe Biden’s nominee for the comptroller of the currency blasted Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin in early 2020, saying he “is supposed to be on the Democratic side” as she discussed Congress’ hesitancy to increase government spending.Saule Omarova, who had been accused of praising Marxist policies, commented during a roundtable discussion on May 20 about her proposal for a National Investment Authority. The authority would serve as a government institution independent of congress and the president directing public and private investments towards “vital infrastructure and the real economy.” While attending Moscow State University, Omarova wrote a thesis titled “Karl Marx’s Economic Analysis and the Theory of Revolution.” Republican Pennsylvania Sen Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, ordered Omarova to turn her thesis over to the committee, which she still hasn’t done. Omarova refuted any ties to Marxist ideology, telling the Financial Times, “I was in the Soviet Union, where there was no academic freedom, and this was a mandatory assigned topic. What I wrote in that paper has nothing to do with what I believe in now.” Omarova argues that part of the need for the National Investment Authority is because members of Congress like Manchin are opposed to huge government spending programs.“It’s fine when, if we have a strong majority in Congress as we are sure that Congress will fund whatever we need, but we can never be sure of that,” Omarova said. “People like Joe Manchin, for example supposed to be on the Democratic side- and yet feel very uncomfortable with big-spending ideas, right?” Omarova said. “To supplement that kind of fiscally constrained and politically constrained kind of spending, we need to make sure we have a strong public institution that can harness the existing abundant private capital and pull it in the right direction.”Joe Biden’s nominee for the Comptroller of the Currency Saule Omarova on oil, coal and gas industries: “We want them to go bankrupt if we want to tackle climate change.” Those industries are responsible for MILLIONS of Americans’ paychecks.Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) November 9, 2021 Omarova also said at the May round table she wants to “starve” companies of money used to invest in the oil and gas industry to combat climate change. She argued for the National Investment Authority to direct money away from the oil and gas industry and towards “clean and green” infrastructure programs.“The way we basically get rid of those carbon financiers is we starve them of their sources of capital,” Omarova said.Omarova was quoted in a 2019 Canadian documentary where she called the financial services sector an “asshole industry.” “The financial services industry, in my view, and I don’t think I’m alone here, is the quintessential asshole industry,” Omarova said in the documentary“Assholes: A Theory.” She was also quoted praising the Soviet Union for its lack of a “gender pay gap” in 2019. “Until I came to the US, I couldn’t imagine that things like gender pay gap still existed in today’s world,” Omarova tweeted in 2019. “Say what you will about old USSR, there was no gender pay gap there. Markets don’t always know best.” In a book titled “The Seven Sins of Wall Street: Big Banks, Their Washington Lackeys, and the Next Financial Crisis,” Omarova praised Marxism, saying how it altered her world views. “Within the first year, my world changed,” Omarova said. “I became disillusioned with official Soviet ideology because of Karl Marx.” Omarova has drawn criticism from Democrats, making her nomination increasingly unlikely. “Some of Ms. Omarova’s past statements about the role of government in the financial system raise real concerns about her ability to impartially serve at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and I’m looking forward to meeting with her to discuss them,” Democratic Montana Sen. and Banking Committee member Jon TesterFox Business on Tuesday.

9406,breitbart-24455494e11616a2ffad63d7d9bc916e,2022-10-23 16:45:00,"ROME — The president of the Pontifical Academy for Life, Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, has defended the appointment of Mariana Mazzucato to the Academy, insisting that her positions may be “pro-choice” but they are not “pro-abortion.”Mariana Mazzucato, an Italian-American economist described by Catholic News Agency (CNA) as “an outspoken advocate of abortion rights,” was one of 14 new members of the Academy appointed by Pope Francis on October 15 to serve a five-year term. In an interview with Catholic News Service (CNS), Archbishop Paglia said that all the members of the Academy “have at heart the value of human life in their area of expertise.” “They are not all Catholics and do not profess all the tenets of the Catholic faith,” he said. “And we know there are differences on the level of ethics, but they defend life in its entirety.” Shortly after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision in June overturning Roe v. Wade , Mazzucato released a flurry of tweets and retweets on Twitter deploring the decision, including a video of commentator Ana Kasparian blasting Christians for imposing their views on society and calling the Bible “your little mythical book.”Mazzucato’s comment on the video was “So good!” Another of her retweets bore the message that “abortion is health care” and “saves lives,” while yet another called the decision one of “the darkest days for women’s rights in my lifetime” and warning that the ruling would “embolden anti-abortion & anti-women forces in other countries too.” Confronted with Mazzucato’s record on social media, Archbishop Paglia said one “cannot judge the deepest convictions of a person by four tweets.” Her tweets may have been “pro-choice” but they were not “pro-abortion,” he added. This is not the first time Paglia has found himself in hot water for ambiguous comments regarding the evil of abortion. Last August, the archbishop called Italy’s controversial Law 194 legalizing abortion “a pillar of society” and insisted that no one wishes to overturn it. Interviewed by Italian state television Rai Tre, Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia lauded the 1978 law allowing abortion in Italy, a move that critics called a new “ground zero of morality.” “I believe that at this point the Law 194 is a pillar of our social life,” the archbishop stated. Giorgia Rombolà, the host of the program, asked the archbishop: “So, Law 194 is not up for debate?” to which he replied, “No, absolutely not.”Mariana Mazzucato Lecturer in Economics of Innovation and Public Value at University College London (UCL) attends 48th edition of Economic Forum of Cernobbio on September 02, 2022 in Cernobbio, Italy. (Pier Marco Tacca/Getty Images)Moreover, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in June, Paglia did not congratulate pro-life Americans on this extraordinary victory for life, but instead took the occasion to urge the passage of more stringent gun laws and the abolishment of capital punishment. “We must fight so that the death penalty is abolished along with abortion,” heat the time. For her part, Mazzucato has declared that Pope Francis is the sort of pontiff an atheist like her can admire. In 2016, she tweeted , “As an atheist, never thought I would love a Pope this much. What a star!” in reference to two comments Francis had made — one suggesting Donald Trump was not a Christian and the other in a U.N. speech when he criticized the global banking system and warned about climate change.",Archbishop Defends Appointment of Pro-Abortion Member to Pontifical Academy for Life

Lagarde discussed inflation in Europe while drawing a distinction in COVID-19 spending between the EU and U.S. Essentially, according to Legarde, the EU subsidized businesses to maintain employment; the EU covered payroll expenses during lockdowns, while the U.S. sent direct payments to the American people who were impacted by the lack of work (basically everyone). Lagarde outlined this difference in spending approach to explain why the Eurozone inflation was less than U.S. inflation. How long did that EU Central Bank explanation hold up? Approximately two months. The U.S. inflation rate is currently estimated at 8.6%, and today the eurozone inflation rate just reached,…. wait for it,… Yep, an exact match at 8.6%. — Inflation in countries using the euro set another eye-watering record, pushed higher by a huge increase in energy costs fueled partly by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Annual inflation in the eurozone’s 19 countries hit 8.6% in June, surging past the 8.1% recorded in May, according to the latest numbers published Friday by the European Union statistics agency, Eurostat. Inflation is at its highest level since recordkeeping for the euro began in 1997. Energy prices rocketed 41.9%, and prices for food, alcohol and tobacco were up 8.9%, both faster than the increases recorded the previous month. Demand for energy has risen as the global economy bounced back from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made things worse. European Union leaders agreed to ban most Russian oil imports by the year’s end, driving a price spike. The 27-nation bloc wants to punish Moscow and reduce its reliance on Russian energy, but it’s also adding to financial pain for people and businesses as utility bills and prices at the pump soar. ( Keep in mind, the EU and the U.S. are both chasing the climate change energy shift as dictated by the World Economic Forum in the Build Back Better program. If you factor in the dramatic impact in both the EU and the U.S. from energy policy; and then if you calculate the COVID-19 spending as a percentage of the GDP from both economies; what you will discover is the direct similarity that creates the 806% inflation match. The EU spent less on their COVID-19 programs. However, as a percentage of their economy they spent about the same as the U.S. Joe Biden spent more, but the U.S. economy is bigger than the combine eurozone. The inflation hitting the EU is almost identical to the inflation hitting the U.S. because the Russian energy sanctions are almost identical in impact to the EU energy sector as Joe Biden’s energy policy (a blockage on energy development) is to the United States. The current similarity in the inflation rate between the U.S. and EU is specifically because politicians in both regions followed the exact same instructions from the World Economic Forum. The outcome is ironically a global synergy as the economies of the EU and USA start to collapse. None of this is accidental. All of this economic turmoil is running on an identical track -on a global basis- because the entire western plan was coordinated and followed. What we are seeing right now is the outcome of the “Build Back Better” roadmap. The “global inflation” is the outcome.",European Union Inflation Hits Record 8.6 Percent for All Nations Using the Euro

However, the original Vikings cast are still keeping in touch, as Katheryn Winnick’s recentKatheryn took to her Instagram Stories on Thursday this week to reveal she had recently met up with her Vikings co-star, Gustaf Skarsgård. The two actors respectively starred as Lagertha and Floki in all six seasons of the epic History drama. However, they haven’t been able to meet up in around four years since completing production on Vikings’ final season.In the caption, she wrote: “After four years reunited with my Goose Floki!” The Lagertha star commonly referred to Gustaf as ‘the Goose’ behind the scenes during their time on Vikings. In 2016, she posted a series of selfies from Comic-Con and wrote: “Never a dull moment with The Goose.” Katheryn, who is of Ukrainian descent, has also been posting in support of the country throughout the ongoing conflict with Russia.She followed her selfie with Gustaf with an image of the Ukrainian flag, adding praying hands and the caption: “Close the sky."" Following the attacks in late February, she updated her Instagram account with a number of images of protesters in Ukraine. “People around the world are protesting to stop this unprovoked, unjustified war,” she wrote. “We are an independent, loving country and deserve to live in peace. Together We Will Win. Together We Can Stop Russian Aggression. Together We Will Prevail.” DON'T MISS: [COMMENT] [EXCLUSIVE] [NEWS]Gustaf also showed support for his co-star’s country of origin in his recent plea to world leaders to act on the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “The timing couldn’t be worse of course as [this] news [risks being] completely drowned by the illegal Russian invasion of the Ukraine,” he wrote on Instagram. “But please help spread [this] news as well. We need to put pressure on our leaders to start acting according to the science.” Outside of her work on Vikings, Katheryn recently reprised her follow-up role as Jenny Hoyt in ABC’s popular crime series, Big Sky.She also appeared alongside Sean Penn and Josh Brolin in the recent drama film, Flag Day.

But this tendentious variability of governments does not affect the continuity of the head of state, elected by Parliament for a predetermined period with respect to which any change in parliamentary majorities is irrelevant. Ultimately, the distinction between the role of the government and that of the head of state lies in the possible variability of the former and in the constitutionally defined stability of the latter. In Italy we have experienced this radical difference in the history of the second post-war period during which seven presidents of the Republic have succeeded, supreme guardians of the Constitution, while governments supported by variable or opposing majorities have changed. This also happens in a semi-presidential regime as in the case of France where Mitterrand, elected head of state by the Socialist Party, twice, during his double mandate, found himself having to appoint centre-right governments. Or as it happened later, when Chirac, president of the Republic from the right, appointed Jospin as head of the government of the Socialist Party, with a consequent radical change of the political program. The distinction of roles that is reflected in the guarantee of stability of the head of state is a fundamental distinctive element. After all, in a republican regime his election does not coincide with the colour of the more or less provisional majority which, over time, defines the formation of governments. The difference is a factor of stability of the democratic regime and of its compliance with the constitution. The essential and specific function of the President of the Republic is intertwined with the temporal limitation of his mandate unlike a monarchical regime such as in the case of Great Britain or Spain. Over the decades we have seen in Italy a single exception when the presidency of Giorgio Napolitano extended beyond the traditional limit in the presence of a state of crisis that had affected not only Italy but the whole of Europe. The circumstance was rightly considered exceptional, and Napolitano after less than two years left the Quirinale to Sergio Mattarella, the new president elected by Parliament. The case that occurred at the end of January, when the parliament renounced the election of the new president, did not occur in a particular and unexpected crisis. The country, although burdened by the difficulties generated by the epidemiological crisis, has started to grow again, with rates among the highest in Europe. Considering the size of the current parliamentary majority in support of the government, the election of the head of state arose as a pure question of selecting among the possible candidates on the basis of their qualities, their political biography, even regardless of their membership in the parliamentary representation . Parliament has had a plurality of possible choices: from the head of government Mario Draghi to a deputy, or to an external exponent who has shown himself for his public functions or with experience in the direction of the government as in the case of Giuliano Amato, appointed in the same days at the presidency of the Constitutional Court. But the same overwhelming majority that supports the government failed to find an agreement for the election of the new president, after the resignation that Mattarella had announced a few months before the deadline. In essence, for no plausible reason, Parliament abdicated one of its essential functions such as the appointment of a new head of state. We had to take note of a parliamentary majority that supports the government, but turns out to be unreliable and unable to carry out a constitutional task that is both elementary and fundamental. One wonders what real role the same coalition of parties can play in a phase of evident difficulty in the country, marked by a high unemployment rate which in the South reaches a level higher than that of Greece. Meanwhile, the effects of the pandemic have exacerbated the pre-existing difficulties of the health system and the school. Difficulties not new but exacerbated by the pandemic in a country that was already experiencing a lower national income, with purchasing power parity, than at the beginning of the century. It is in this context that the great majority of the government, responsible for guaranteeing an acceptable level of political stability in the country, failed to agree on the election of the President of the Republic, resorting to the re-election of Mattarella who, having fulfilled his dignified task for seven years, he had announced months in advance of his decision, in harmony with the de facto Constitution and the country’s political tradition, to deem his function exhausted. That the country was going through a difficult phase dominated by the pandemic crisis is beyond question. But it is not the only case in Europe. The elections took place in many countries affected by the pandemic and its economic and social consequences. But this did not prevent recourse to the polls. Great Britain, Germany, Holland, Portugal have regularly called elections. France is preparing to hold them next spring. But in Italy the ordinary democratic rules of political representation with recourse to elections, when made necessary by the crisis of the alignments, have been suspended. The policy of the current government majority is questionable due to the distance between the measures adopted and the difficult situation of large sections of the population affected by the crisis. But even in these circumstances, indeed precisely in relation to these circumstances, it cannot reasonably be assumed that his impotence would lead to the impossibility of electing a new President of the Republic after the resignation announced many months in advance by President Mattarella. A picture of political powerlessness difficult to predict, even beyond the most pessimistic forecasts.

Fully 56% said they want the party to pick someone else. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, on the other hand, slightly favor former president Donald Trump (47%) over other candidates (46%). Among Americans in general, Biden’s support remains low, with just 39% of respondents approving of his job performance while 53% disapprove. He scores the worst on the economy, with a mere 36% voicing approval of his handling of the issue, and that bodes ill for Democrats even before 2024, given that 84% of voters consider the economy a top issue influencing their vote for Congress. In a Biden-Trump rematch, Biden comes out ahead, netting 48% of the vote to Trump’s 46% but if only registered voters are polled, the numbers reverse, with Trump coming out on top. At the same time, 52% of respondents think Trump should be charged with a crime regarding at least one of the federal investigations currently underway against him.The poll suggests November’s elections will supply a narrow win for Republicans, with 47% of registered voters favoring the Republican candidate in their House district to 46% preferring the Democrat, a split that widens to 51-46 when only those who said they were likely or certain to vote are considered. Economy is the top issue in voters' minds for the midterms, with Republicans seen as more capable of handling it by a 16-point difference.

David McKinley, who pressed the EPA chief on why the Obama administration was moving forward with economically-damaging regulations that do nothing for the environment. “I don’t understand,” McKinley said in a Tuesday hearing. “If it doesn’t have an impact on climate change around the world, why are we subjecting our hard working taxpayers and men and women in the coal fields to something that has no benefit?” “We see it as having had enormous benefit in showing sort of domestic leadership as well as garnering support around the country for the agreement we reached in Paris,” McCarthy responded. McKinley was referring to EPA’s so-called Clean Power Plan, which forces states to cut carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. The CPP is expected to double the amount of coal plant closings in the coming years, and even EPA admits it won’t have a measurable impact on projected global warming.EPA has long argued the point of the CPP was to show the world America was serious about tackling global warming in order to galvanize support for United Nations delegates to sign a global agreement to cut emissions. Nearly 200 countries agreed to a U.N. deal last year. “But even then no one is following us,” McKinley said. “Since that Paris accord China has already announced that they’re going to put up 360 [coal plants]. India has announced that they’re going to double their use of coal since the Paris accord.” China has made promises to curb its coal use in order to tackle the country’s horrible air pollution problems, butby 2020.

One thing the Davos-based group seems to be pushing are the activities of an organization called the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) – and its freshly published Greenhouse Gas Rulebook. TRUTH LIVES on at manages to work a type of digital ID into the whole story, as a component in monitoring the impact car batteries have on the environment, with the rulebook designed to calculate and track “greenhouse gas” footprint linked to lithium-ion batteries, whether used in vehicles or elsewhere. The post, penned by Co-Chair of the Global Battery Alliance Benedikt Sobotka and German chemicals giant BASF CEO and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors Martin Brudermuller, first speaks about this basically being the year of a huge global energy crisis, one they think will result in a move away from natural gas and oil. And while growing electric car sales are viewed as a positive thing, the authors say there is not enough “transparency” when it comes to their effect on the environment. The fact is mentioned that although electric cars are considered environment-friendly, the batteries are actually made from materials like lithium, copper, and iron – this, in the context of the mining industry not being the “cleanest” out there. Regardless, the main point seems to be to obtain insights which can ultimately lead to establishing control over how people use their batteries, and as is so often the case with the WEF-backed initiatives, establishing rules and standards before legitimate international organizations or nation-states can make their own. And so the rulebook is said to include guidance from both the EU and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) – but also, adds “around 80 globally harmonized rules in an easy-to-use format” of its own. And then, the rulebook “aims to provide a sound method by which to generate and collect process-specific data, so users and manufacturers can compare the carbon footprints across vendors of batteries and their components.” via a framework for data collection for “the Battery Passport” – “providing an unprecedented, wide-reaching seal of assurance on the sustainability, provenance and governance of the batteries that are powering the EV (electric vehicle) revolution.” The Battery Passport consists of “a digital ID for batteries containing data and descriptions about the ESG performance, manufacturing history, and provenance as well as advancing battery life extension and enabling recycling.” It also consists of, “a digital platform that will collect, exchange, collate and report data among all authorized lifecycle stakeholders to advance a sustainable value chain for electric vehicle (EV) and stationary batteries. It will transparently report progress toward global goals along the battery value chain to inform policy-making for governments, the civil society and develop performance benchmarks.”","WEF publishes post on digital “Battery Passport,” described as “a digital ID for batteries”"

The plan calls for replacing coal with natural gas beginning on October 1.“Emissions from heavily polluting fuels like coal for various industrial, domestic, and miscellaneous purposes contribute significantly to the degradation of air quality in the NCR [National Capital Region] and adjoining areas, and accordingly a consistent need has been felt to switch over to lesser polluting and cleaner fuel in the region,” CAQM said. The Times of India (TOI) noted coal is currently the dominant industrial fuel in the NCR. About 1.7 million tonnes of coal are consumed by industrial operations in the area each year. The phase-out plan envisions eliminating almost all of this reliance on coal, with the exception of low-sulfur coal burned in power plants. On Wednesday, India announced it would produce a checklist of one hundred “climate-friendly behaviors,” developed in collaboration with the United Nations, for its citizens to follow. The “Behavior Change for Climate Action” initiative will be promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, which the U.N. hasas World Environment Day. The Times of India said the idea is to solicit suggestions for “behavior-change solutions/ideas aimed to drive climate-friendly behaviors in various sectors including water, transport, food, electricity, recycle, and reuse” at the level of “individuals, communities, and organizations.” A conference will be held in India, sometime after the deadline for submissions on December 3, to choose the top 100 behavioral modifications. The authors of the winning submissions will receive “U.N. Global LIFE Ambassador awards” at a climate change conference in Egypt. India’s previous effort to reduce coal consumption collapsed in May, as a heatwave caused energy demand to spike. Industrial managers tried to cope with a dramatic coal shortage by using diesel-powered generators, which tripled their energy costs. With blackouts rolling across the country, Modi ordered coal-fired power plants to return to full capacity and coal mines to increase production by up to 50 percent without applying for new permits. Over 100 coal mines previously shuttered as unprofitable wereto meet skyrocketing demand. India and China, which also burns titanic amounts of coal , were able to pressure the COP26 climate conference in November to water down its demand for a “phase out” of coal power. Instead, the concluding statement from COP26 asked member nations to “phase down” coal. Soon afterward, both India and China began phasing coal up.","India Bans Coal Use in Capital, Debuts Green Behavior Checklist for Citizens"

The Biden administration is carrying out a massive escalation of the conflict, vowing to pour tens of billions of dollars of weaponry into the war and declaring that its aim is to carry out a strategic defeat of Russia. The coronavirus pandemic, now in its third year, has killed 20 million people worldwide. New variants are spreading across the world even as the capitalist governments declare the pandemic over and end all restrictions on business aimed at stopping the spread. The world’s banks and corporations are bringing immense pressure on China to end its Zero Covid policy, which would lead to millions more deaths. The unrestrained spread of the virus risks new, more deadly variants that may render vaccines ineffective. During the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s ruling elite carried out a massive transfer of wealth, hoarding unprecedented sums and throwing billions deeper into poverty. After piling the developing economies with debt, the IMF and World Bank are demanding ruthless restructuring programs that will slash social spending, cause deeper hardship and intensify the class struggle. The capitalist markets are deeply unstable, commodity prices are surging and supply chains are breaking down. War sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and European imperialist powers are driving hundreds of millions of people into famine. In the developing world, the loss of food and fertilizer exports from the breadbasket of Eastern Europe means mass starvation is on the horizon. In the advanced countries, price increases mean hundreds of millions more are struggling to stay alive or out of poverty.

Those who escape death en route to Europe and North America face brutal repression, detention, criminalization and deportation in these lands of “democracy.” In country after country, powerful sections of the ruling class are turning to fascism and dictatorship to suppress social opposition in the working class. In the US, Donald Trump remains at liberty even though it is impossible to deny his involvement in a dictatorial coup attempt. In France, Marine Le Pen secured the highest vote total for a fascist candidate in the country’s history. The growth of the far-right and the ruling class’s move toward dictatorial forms of rule are an international phenomenon from which no region is immune. The same contradictions that give rise to war and reaction also demonstrate the potential and the need for a revolutionary transformation of society. All over the world, millions of workers of every race and nationality are demonstrating, protesting and striking against the intolerable conditions of life under capitalism. This growing movement has the power to stop war and take power out of the hands of a financial aristocracy whose continued rule threatens the world with destruction. In Sri Lanka, Iran, South Africa, Peru, Iraq, Vietnam, Argentina, Sudan, Indonesia, Brazil, Spain, Turkey, Finland and many more countries, mass movements or strike waves are developing against living costs that have spiraled out of control as a result of the war in Ukraine and imperialist sanctions. Powerful strike movements are now emerging in the countries whose governments plotted the war, including in the United States and the United Kingdom. This growing movement needs political leadership.

There certainly seems to be more than one understanding of this phrase. Here is our shot at it. Of course, there are scholars of Hegel/Marx who read this site, and we welcome any corrections or other interpretations of this well known phrase. Picking Global Warming as an example, we have a completely invented problem which of course can be manipulated in any way needed to end up at the point you want to land on. Primarily, the destruction of the West with its notions of free market economy and individual rights. Since the problem is fake, and created and enforced by “consensus” (See video below) all the reactions from people calling it out as fake must be dealt with using the dialectic attack of hate speech. This was fabricated by a second generation Frankfurt School acolyte, a certain Habermas, in the form of “Discourse Theory”. For the past many decades, various leftist controlled governments and leftist think tanks, have attempted to use the element of Carbon as a means to control industry and humanity in a highly selective manner. Like slavery as an issue , we must only examine the ‘problem’ of CO2 production in Western and free market nations, more accurately perhaps, in cultures with the concept of individual rights as being sacrosanct. We must not look at slavery in Africa or Islam ever but must focus on the past actions in The USA pretty much exclusively in terms of passing moral judgment. And we must not look at really dirty industrial activity, let alone CO2 production in China or India but must pretend that CO2 produced by any and all means connected to humans in the West as an existential threat to the entire planet.There should be no need to try and disprove the idea that CO2 is a problem on this site. I do have a dedicated page to the science of it here on Vlad but I don’t maintain it very well as to engage in a debate based on a lie is to lose that debate since only one side seeks to know the truth and the power of the lie is much greater in the short run. At least where the goal is destruction. One fact though, is that where CO2 is produced, more life happens. Plants grow etc. Plants, and life, are made of carbon. Even on the side of highways, plants tend to thrive from a truly poisonous form of carbon, CO1 or Carbon monoxide. CO2 is actually pumped into greenhouses to help plants hit their optimal growth rate. But let’s pretend that CO2 production was a problem. Then why are those who wrap themselves in a false flag of environmentalism, so opposed to nuclear power? Its the obvious solution to those who claim that carbon dioxide is an existential threat to the planet. Whatever the issues with nuclear power, it cannot be as bad as that. And then there is this: Geothermal.A very worthy deeper dive: So we have a solution now for food production that is safe, energy efficient and absorbs far more carbon than it produces. Global Warming is a consensus based thing though. Meaning communists agreed on creating it and presenting it as an existential problem in order to get to the solution they want, which is communism. No real world approach to solving even the non-problem of “global-warming” will be entertained and any attempt to expose it as the fraud it is will be met with charges akin to hate speech. “Climate-denier” for example, makes moral equivalence with a Holocaust denier to one who would deny the ‘existential threat of global warming’. A fairly palpable use of the Hate-Speech tactic.More recently, in order to destroy farming in the Netherlands and replace these farms with what will almost certainly be beehive brutalist housing for illegal mostly Muslim and African migrants forced on the local population since before 2015, a new element and compound had to be demonized as an existential threat. Nitrogen, which makes up damn near 80% of the total atmosphere, and ammonia. I won’t even bother to deal with the issue of nitrogen. To think that the tiny amount of nitrogen released on a few dutch farms justify the actions against farmers we see in the Netherlands is even worthy of rebuttal on that basis, means a lack of understanding of the tactic at play. Much like when one knows that nearly all human beings are born either a man or a woman (with the exception of extremely few genetic mutations which end with those individuals as they tend to be sterile) and to pretend these are fungible is, well risible. So let’s look at the new threat of ammonia. How could we somehow solve the issue of ammonia in a way that would satisfy those who claim its a problem while maybe at the same time, solving other problems many are concerned about:The bottom line is: The problems we are bombarded with, from Covid to vaccine hesitancy. From global warming to cow flatulence. From Nitrogen to ammonia, are all fake problems which, even by engaging about it, causes us to lose. These are not problems at all, and some, to the extent they might be, are selectively enforced against the Western nations and peoples with zero effort to deal with these non-problems in places like China, North Korea, India and other places where the raw production of these gasses and so on are orders of magnitude higher than in the West. We need to understand that so much of what we engage with on a day to day basis is we, the intellectual descendants of Socrates, being constantly basted with pseudo-reality and false cosmologies in order to destroy Western civilization where it actually lives.

There is no climate emergency, say the authors, who are drawn from across the world and led by the Norwegian physics Nobel Prize laureate Professor Ivar Giaever. Climate science is said to have degenerated into a discussion based on beliefs, not on sound self-critical science. The scale of the opposition to modern day ‘settled’ climate science is remarkable, given how difficult it is in academia to raise grants for any climate research that departs from the political orthodoxy. (A full list of the signatories is available here .) Another lead author of the declaration, Professor Richard Lindzen, has called the current climate narrative “absurd”, but acknowledged that trillions of dollars and the relentless propaganda from grant-dependent academics and agenda-driven journalists currently says it is not absurd. Particular ire in the WCD is reserved for climate models. To believe in the outcome of a climate model is to believe what the model makers have put in. Climate models are now central to today’s climate discussion and the scientists see this as a problem. “We should free ourselves from the naïve belief in immature climate models,” says the WCD. “In future, climate research must give significantly more emphasis to empirical science.” Since emerging from the ‘Little Ice Age’ in around 1850, the world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCC on the basis of modelled human influences. “The gap between the real world and the modelled world tells us that we are far from understanding climate change,” the WCD notes.","1,200 Scientists and Professionals Declare: “The..."

Vilsack first insisted that you and I had to adjust our taste buds. Really I didn’t want to adjust my taste buds. I didn’t think you should have to either. My first grave encounter came in the form of a post circa 2011. He and l started out on the wrong foot. But it turns out that was just a minor thing. Just what else did he have in mind? A long and difficult corrupt road.U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told members of the National Restaurant Association on Monday that Americans need to “adjust” their tastes so that they like the kind of food the government believes they should eatand “we have to make sure that what we do is create the appropriate transition.” “It’s going to take time for people’s taste to adjust and they will adjust over time, but it will take some time,” he said. “So, we have to make sure that what we do is create the appropriate transition. (Ah, just part of the great reset) “At the end of the day, though, we’ve got to deal with this,” said Vilsack. Full story at CNS> Sadly all the video’s of my pal extolling these virtues and his behavior have been removed by YouTube.Big bucks coming to the right folks and he is the man who did it before and plans on doing it again. But just who is Vilsack? Our intrepid Mustang picks up the story. Some things are just weird by Mustang. On 23 February 2021, the U.S. Senate was in the hands of (ugh) Democrats which is not very different than a U.S. Senate in the hands of (ugh) Republicans. In any case, is there any real difference? Some would argue, “No, there isn’t.” And among those people, there is plenty of justification for that argument. Take Little Tommy Vilsack, for example. There was never a more dyed-in-the-wool socialist serving in government since Franklin Roosevelt. Yet, the U.S. Senate, whose majority in that august body is exactly two, voted to confirm Tom Vilsack to serve as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture by a vote of 92 to 7. An overwhelming victory for the man who authorized the distribution of federal welfare benefits application forms, printed in Spanish, to potential illegal aliens living in Mexico. At best, Vilsack’s confirmation should have netted him no more than 50-48. In a real world where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average. Vilsack was born in an orphanage. Now, this wasn’t his fault, but understanding his early years may help us to understand how he drifted left into that netherworld where there is nether any patriotism nor common sense. So, the baby tagged with a question mark was adopted by Bud and Dolly Vilsack, who named him Thomas James. Vilsack graduated from the Shady Side Academy. That’s all I’m going to say about that. According to my sources (whose initials are KID), Tommy asked Christie to marry him after confirming that she didn’t vote for Richard Nixon and found out that her father owned a law firm in Mount Pleasant. After marrying Christie, Tom went to work for her father. It’s sometimes interesting how things work out, eh? In any case, Tom made it into the world of politics as Mayor of Mount Pleasant, Iowa senator, governor of Iowa, failed Presidential candidate, and Secretary of Agriculture under both Obama and Biden. Vilsack is the longest (ever) serving Secretary of Agriculture in the entire galaxy. The amazing thing about Vilsack’s election as governor is that he was elected by a small margin. Jaded political analysts think all those dead people voting capped the election in Vilsack’s favor, but that’s probably just trash talk. Still, Iowa has only had five democrat governors in the entire 20th century, so were it not for Vilsack signing an executive order allowing 115,000 convicted felons to vote, he might still be a mayor over near Lake Wobegon. The question is, how far left is Vilsack? I answer you decide: Vilsack was on Hillary Clinton’s shortlist as her vice presidential candidate. That’s pretty far left. No one ever accused Tom Vilsack of being a genius; indeed, he isn’t. So if you want to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil, what do you do? You agree with your president to shut down all domestic oil production. So now the curtain begins to rise, and we can understand how the U.S. Senate, with 48 conservative seats, overwhelmingly confirmed Vilsack as U.S.D.A. Secretary. No, we don’t understand that at all. His first confirmation vote for that position in 2009 was unanimous consent. Amazing. And Tom Vilsack re-introduced us to Shirley Sherrod. He previously hired her as the Director, Rural Development in Georgia. Vilsack ended up firing Shirley Sherrod (nothing personal, just business), but he recently rehired her as an advisor on the U.S.D.A.’s new Equity Committee. That should help propel America forward, but it’s hardly change we can believe in In fairness, though, Shirley needed the money. She’s only worth $5 million. One month before Obama left office, Vilsack resigned his office and re-entered the world of unemployment. A short time later, though, he accepted a position as President of the U.S. Dairy Export Council. No, no conflict of interest there. Nothing to see. Move on, please. Well, I don’t blame him. The Council paid him $999,421 a year. That’s almost as good as being an employee of the U.S.D.A. and then suing them for their racialist policies. Well, good for Tom but I’ll be thinking about his salary the next time I purchase a jug of milk. So, Vilsack is back and an amazing thing about his acceptance of Biden’s nomination is that in 2015 Vilsack notified Obama that he was thinking about resigning because he “didn’t have enough to do.” Okay, well, the job is far from $999,421 (before taxes), but it’s better than having to go to work in the morning. I’m looking forward to Tom Vilsack’s biographical memoir: How I escaped going to federal prison Bunks Bonus: Maybe Vislack can get some ideas how the Netherlands are dealing with climate change and the farmers.",AG Secretary Vilsack and His Too Much Funny Business
924,newswars-91dab3642f28b882b41327a48857ce5f,2022-05-12 15:37:00,"Droughts have increased 29% in the space of a single generation, according to a paper the United Nations released on Wednesday, which observed that the problem is rapidly accelerating. Released to coincide with the 15th annual Conference of Parties held by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, the “ Drought in Numbers 2022 report reveals that droughts comprise just 15% of natural disasters but account for 45% of disaster-related deaths, along with an encyclopedia of other disturbing statistics.From 1998 to 2017, droughts cost the world $124 billion, the report found. They also took some 650,000 lives between 1970 and 2019, and the report warns that over 2.3 billion people are currently living in water-insecure conditions, including 160 million children. In the US alone, drought-related economic losses have amounted to $249 billion since 1980. Worsening drought conditions will put upwards of 700 million people at risk of becoming climate refugees by 2030 if something is not done to address the issue, the report warns. By 2040, a quarter of the world’s children will live in places with “ extreme ” water shortages, and by 2050, over three quarters of the population could be similarly affected. While 3.6 billion people currently live in areas where water is scarce for at least one month out of the year, that figure could increase to 4.8 billion or even as much as 5.7 billion by mid-century.In total, worsening drought conditions combined with crop failures, sea-level rises, and overpopulation could force as many as 216 million people to leave their homes, according to the report worsening existing refugee crises and ambushing governments unprepared for such catastrophes. Regarding solutions, UN Convention to Combat Desertification Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw has focused his efforts on land restoration, suggesting governments build landscapes capable of “mimicking nature” with “functional ecological systems.” He cites the example of Niger, where farmers have rebuilt agroforestry systems on 12 million acres of land over the past two decades, as a success story to be emulated. Africa suffers more than any other continent from the effects of drought, with the UN having recorded some 300 critical drought events over the last century nearly half (44%) the global total. However, given its greater population, Asia is the continent with the largest number of humans most at risk from drought. Additionally, Australia’s severe droughts in recent years are believed to have caused the “ mega fires ” that preceded the Covid-19 epidemic on the continent from 2019 to 2020, killing or displacing three billion animals. Even Europe is said to be suffering to a growing extent from agricultural losses related to drought, as is North America, while South America’s Amazon rainforest is expected to lose 16% of its remaining mass by 2050 if behavioral patterns are not changed.Thiaw called for shifting the UN’s approach from reacting to crises to anticipating them, calculating risk and acting accordingly before the situation becomes untenable. This, he says, will require effective early warning systems, sufficient funds, and the political will to get the job done no small ask from an organization with 196 member states. Regardless of how humanity deals with the problem, the world is facing “an upward trajectory in the duration of droughts and the severity of impacts,” he writes, “not only affecting human societies but also the ecological systems upon which the survival of all life depends, including that of our own species.”Other solutions proposed in the report include the usual UN goals like reducing meat consumption and land use, increasing surveillance of both nature and human activity to create “early warning systems,” deploying artificial intelligence to evaluate and manage problems, declaring large areas of land off-limits to human use, using narratives to elicit desired social behaviors, and building supranational control systems as an end-run around uncooperative local politics, much the same as the UN has sought with regard to climate change. Merely telling stories about droughts can have an effect, one 2017 case study found inserting 100 drought stories into the news cycle over two months led to a reduction of between 11 and 18% in household water use in California. Ultimately, the organization hopes to restore one billion hectares of “degraded” land by 2030 and preemptively tackle “escalating droughts, sand and dust storms, wildfires and other disaster risks,” in many cases by removing humans from the equation i.e “future-proofing land use against the impacts of climate change.”",UN Issues Drought Disaster Warning

I fundamentally believe that President Trump is just not the smartest guy. I think he’s educated, but I just don’t think he’s that smart.

What that tells me is he’s brilliant, and the cruelty is the point he’s sending immigrants all over the place and not taking care of them, and that scares me.” Hostin added, “That’s what the scary part is like I was saying because he’s so smart, he’s read all of this.

3384,sgtreport-585b02733dc1f0d4ff92543850dcdbf4,2022-09-01 16:04:00,"In a recent interview with Financial Times , Henry Kaufman, the original “Dr. Doom” who spent most of his career as an economist at Salomon Brothers, expressed his fears that the current Fed under Jerome Powell is failing to combat inflation as Paul Volcker did in the 1980s. “I am still waiting for him to act boldly,” says Kaufman. “Today, the inflation rate is higher than interest rates. Back then, interest rates were higher than inflation rates. It’s quite a juxtaposition. We have a long way to go. Inflation has to come down or interest rates will go higher.” However, this kind of old-world thinking is not what moves Wall Street or other financial centers around the world. The new-world thinking is attached firmly to the notion of a pivot, but what if the Fed never really pivots? Or never really tightens? What if it simply continues to raise rates but never achieves full lift-off? TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/ Perhaps it’s time we developed definitions for the terms dovish and hawkish more suitable for the times. Is it hawkish or dovish to raise rates but keep them a considerable distance from the inflation rate? In our view, it is simplistic to call the Fed hawkish simply because it raises rates. The central banks of Argentina, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe have been raising rates for years, yet their inflation rates are now 70%, 167%, and 257%, respectively, and climbing. No one would be so foolish as to characterize their central banks as hawkish – nor their stock and bond markets as stable. Yet, Wall Street reacts to the act of raising rates as if it were a market edict delivered from atop Mount Sinai when the real effect on inflation might be to moderate rather than throttle it. In short, we may be headed back to the 1970s and a time when central bankers talked the talk on taming inflation but never really walked the walk. MarshMcClennan, which advises top wealth managers, private banks, and family offices, says it used to be that portfolios were geared to a disinflationary climate well-suited for stock and bond ownership. Now, for the “first time in a generation,” it says in a recently-issued report , investment managers need to seriously consider persistent inflation and stagflation in their planning. “Inflationary scenarios, especially stagflation,” it advises, “leave most portfolios vulnerable. Here, commodity-oriented strategies and gold may prove valuable additions to portfolios.” (Please see chart below.) “Gold,” it concludes, “is a special case commodity. Historically, it has done well when fear of inflation is high, specifically inflation driven by monetary expansion, having a high sensitivity to inflation when inflation is on a runaway trajectory. Gold may outperform broader commodities in a stagflation scenario (high inflation during a period of stagnating growth), being largely decoupled from industrial demand, and, typically, it has underperformed broader commodities in an inflationary environment that comes with economic growth. That gold often comes into its own in higher inflation scenarios is related to its close relationship to currency debasement.” Gold, Stocks, and the Misery Index during the Stagflationary 1970s (% change, annual; Misery Index = Inflation + Unemployment) Data sources: St. Louis Federal Reserve [FRED],  titled The Emotional Scars of Inflation Will Shake the Foundations of Western Societies , “like the United States and the United Kingdom had been so low for so long that one needed to be well into middle age to remember what living through the price surges of the late 1970s was like. It was bad.… But the headline numbers do not reveal the toll that high inflation takes.” Market analysts tend to crunch the numbers without giving much thought to the net effect of economic maladjustment – like inflation – on daily life and the culture in which it occurs. Coyle makes reference to the 1970s and the German nightmare inflation of the 1920s, which continues, she says, to have “an impact on economic policy-making to this day.” Too, we would attribute a large proportion of the robust demand for gold and silver coins over the past year to older investors who remember the debilitating effects of the 1970s stagflation – and how well investors did who purchased those items in the early part of the decade. IN A CAPTIVATING PROFILE OF GOLD posted at the Data Driven Investor, analyst Dr. Jemeljanov passes along an old Scottish proverb on building financial security: “Get what you can, and keep what you have, that’s the way to get rich.” Gold, he believes, plays a critical role in the second part of that formulation. “[T]he demand for gold persists,” he says “due to the fact that during periods of instability and higher price volatility, the price of gold tends to have a negative correlation with the prices of other assets. This implies that in situations of financial stress, gold prices often rise while prices for other assets fall, thereby increasing the role of gold as a universal ‘diversifier’ of the investment portfolio, regardless of the source of financial stress. This differentiates gold from other ways to protect the value of your portfolio by using, for example, derivative financial instruments since these are focused on protecting the portfolio against some specific risks.” ROCKEFELLER INTERNATIONAL’S RUCHIR SHARMA WARNS that the US dollar might be on the verge of major turnaround based on a confluence of historical factors, much like what occurred under similar circumstances in the early 2000s. “What happened two decades ago,” he writes in a Financial Times editorial , “suggests the dollar is closer to peaking than rallying further. Even as US stocks fell in the dotcom bust, the dollar continued rising, before entering a decline that started in 2002 and lasted six years. A similar turning point may be near. And this time, the US currency’s decline could last even longer.” Kuchir’s editorial is headlined, “A post-dollar world is coming.” If he is correct that the dollar is peaking (and he makes a compelling argument), it will fall in line with the progression of lower highs shown in the long-term chart above. Those long-term lower highs have preceded lower lows, and those lower lows, in turn, have coincided with sharp increases in the gold price, particularly in the period 2000 to 2011. Gold and the US Dollar Index (%, 1971-present) Chart courtesy of TradingView.com WHAT SHOULD BE NOTED IN THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY is that inflation, not unemployment, drove the Misery Index in the 1970s, and it is driving it now. It would be a good thing if economists and the financial press began including a modifier to the word recession as a matter of routine – stagflationary , as in stagflationary recession to differentiate it from the traditional kind driven by unemployment, bankruptcies, systemic risks, et al. It would give investors and consumers are more defined sense of what we are up against. “I cannot recall a time during the past 75 years,” writes former German foreign minister Joschka Fischer, “when there has been such a massive accumulation of major and minor shocks. The world today is dealing with intensifying climate change, a pandemic, major wars, surging inflation, disruptions to international trade and supply chains, and acute food and energy shortages.” He says that the West did not anticipate the consequences of its “economic dependencies” on rivals China and Russia. “The bill for this naivete,” he says, “is now coming due and it will be large.” He concludes that we are in the final act of the 75-year Pax Americana that began after World War II. The 2024 election, he says, may be the first American election to have “direct civilizational and planetary consequences.” Echoes of The Fourth Turning. TAKING A LONG-TERM VIEW, technical analyst Chris Vermeulen counsels patience as we are now in a period that compares favorably to conditions just before the launch of gold and silver’s secular bull market in 2002-2003. “If Gold/Silver are repeating a 2002-03 setup,” he asks in an analysis posted at MoneyShow after listing the comparisons, “what can we expect in the future? Then the breakout trend starts in gold, which could happen as early as 2023 or 2024, I believe the next rally target for gold will be somewhere above $3100. Then, we start a dedicated climb to levels above $4500 and beyond. It is difficult to predict any date targets for this type of rally, but I’m trying to illustrate what I see related to the similarities of the 1989~2003 market conditions with what I’m seeing right now. If you were around to live through this incredibly exciting time, you may remember many of these events. I’m suggesting we may be starting to move through similar events right now and I suspect we are somewhere near August 2000 right now.”","A Market Edict Delivered from Mount Sinai, or a Repeat of the 1970s?"
8681,thenewamerican-bf2cbcbdf7fa4423ab9d8e2beacbb8a5,2022-03-18 16:05:00,"Larry Elder. I arrived early for my dinner with a friend at a restaurant on the Westside of Los Angeles. At the table to my right sat two women. We started talking. They had known each other since second grade, and one was celebrating her 85th birthday. One was a psychotherapist, the other a “human rights activist.” Both were Jewish. A few minutes into the conversation, one said: “Wait. I know who you are. You ran for governor.” After I confirmed her suspicion, she said, “Guess who I voted for.” I smiled. “You didn’t vote for me.” “How do you know?” she asked. I said, “Let’s see. We’re at a restaurant in West LA. You’re Jewish and a psychotherapist. Your friend is a human rights activist. Read the clues. You’re both Democrats and no one could pay you to vote for a Republican.” They acknowledged that they voted against the recall of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. I asked, “How do you feel about rising violent crime?” They both called the increase “outrageous,” and even criticized the soft-on-crime Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon, currently facing his second recall attempt. A vote among his assistant district attorneys found that 98% of them wanted Gascon to resign. “How do you feel about our homelessness problem?” I asked. The human rights activist responded, “If we provide housing and treatment — and there’s plenty of money for both — then I don’t understand why people are allowed to remain on the streets.” I said, “That was exactly my position during the campaign.” “What about the quality of California’s K-12 government schools?” I continued: “Pre-pandemic, nearly 70% of black third graders could not read at state proficiency levels, with math scores not much better. Almost half of all third graders cannot read at state proficiency levels, with math scores about the same. Are you OK with that?” They both called it “a travesty.”We turned to the governor’s draconian COVID-19 lockdown of business and of in-school education. They said they had been “double-vaxxed with a booster.” “So have I,” I said. “We’re in high-risk categories. But I don’t think the state should’ve been shut down when the risk for young and healthy people is low. Do you?” They agreed with me. “So,” I said. “You agree with me on virtually every issue, yet you voted to retain Newsom.” Before they could answer, I said, “I’ll tell you why. You … just … could … not … bring … yourself … to … pull … that … lever … for … a … Republican!” They laughed and said, “I guess you’re right.” In fact, a recent University of California, Berkeley, poll found that Californians rate Newsom underwater on 9 of 10 issues, including crime, education, jobs, homelessness, state budget, drought, wildfires, the economy and health care. His unfavorable number on homelessness is six times higher than his favorable number. The only positive for Newsom was “climate change,” where he stood one point above disapproval. Overall, Newsom has a 48% job approval rating. It is tempting to suggest that were a vote held today, Newsom would lose. But during the recall his approval rating was only two points higher, and he survived recall with 62% of the vote. The overwhelmingly Democratic and Democrat-leaning independent voters in California, like my restaurant companions, just … could … not … bring … themselves … to … vote … for … a … Republican — especially one who voted for former President Donald Trump. At his victory speech the night he survived the recall, Newsom said, “I said this many, many times on the campaign trail: we may have defeated Trump, but Trumpism is not dead in this country.” “Trumpism?” As for the ladies in the restaurant, we soon started completing each other’s sentences. “What are you drinking?” they asked. They ended up buying me two drinks, and even paid for my lobster dinner. Trumpism rested. For at least one evening. Larry Elder is a bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk show host.

7153,breitbart-a3272d5a4e7f245b773f1561c843bc95,2022-04-08 15:09:00,"Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations put oil company executives in the hot seat at a hearing on Wednesday, accusing the corporations of making profits from the Russia invasion of Ukraine amid oil shortages and high prices for gas at the pump.Executives from ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP America, Shell USA, Pioneer Natural Resources Company, and Devon Energy Corporation pushed back against Democrats, who demonized them at the hearing. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), chairwoman of the subcommittee, said in her opening remarks: While American families are forced to pay record-high prices at the pump, frankly this committee is not going to sit back and allow this system — which forces American taxpayers to pay oil companies out of both pockets, first at the pump and then through tax breaks — to continue in its current form. “I want to be absolutely clear: We do not control the market price of crude oil or natural gas, nor of refined products like gasoline and diesel fuel, and we have no tolerance for price gouging,” Chevron CEO Michael Wirth said at the hearing. The Democrats did not mention Joe Biden’s ongoing war against domestic production of oil and gas, from shutting down pipelines to halting offshore drilling permits through 2023. But the executives called for a change in policy. “While there is no quick fix, the answer in the near term, until there are more widely available and affordable alternatives, is straightforward,” Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil, said. “We need to increase the supply of oil and natural gas. Gretchen H. Watkins, president of Shell USA, said: The Interior Department should end its pause on federal oil and gas leasing and instead direct urgent attention to accelerating and completing its legal and administrative work necessary to restart federal lease sales, along with appropriate environmental safeguards, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, which is among the lowest greenhouse gas intensive production in the world. Experts in the energy sector reacted to the hearing by issuing statements to the media. Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at The Competitive Enterprise Institute, said: House Democrats today hypocritically tried to blame high gasoline prices on price gouging by oil companies, but when prices were much lower during the Trump administration, they failed to thank oil companies for not price gouging. House Democrats today hypocritically demanded that oil company CEOs increase oil production, while six months ago House Democrats demanded that the same CEOs promise to reduce oil production. The highlight of today’s charade of a hearing was Representative Bill Johnson, Republican of Ohio, who pleaded with oil company CEOs to stop apologizing for not being green enough and instead proudly defend their industry for the energy they produce that keeps America and the world moving. James Taylor, president of The Heartland Institute, said: Today’s hearing perfectly illustrated how congressional Democrats are in complete denial about how their anti-energy policies predictably drive up energy prices. The oil industry averages a mere 2.5-percent profit per year, which is far less than most other industries in our economy, including the Wall Street financial industry that so heavily funds Democratic politicians. “Joe Biden and congressional Democrats are the ones who have driven up oil and gasoline prices, not the hard-working Americans who produce domestic oil and gasoline despite being vilified and shackled by Biden administration policies,” Taylor said.

A new study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has concluded that cleaner air over Europe and the United States may be leading to an increase in tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the Atlantic Ocean. The, published on May 11 in Science Advances , concludes that “decreases in aerosols over Europe and the United States have contributed to significant decreases in TCs over the Southern Hemisphere as well as increases in TCs over the North Atlantic.” According to the study, aerosol pollution — which is made up of particulate matter such as dust, dirt, soot, and smoke — has decreased drastically in Europe and the U.S. since approximately 1980. Conversely, an increase in the same particulate matter in the Southern Hemisphere and East Asia is leading to fewer tropical cyclones in that area of the world. “Over the past 40 years, anthropogenic aerosols have been substantially decreasing over Europe and the United States owing to pollution control measures, whereas they have increased in South and East Asia because of the economic and industrial growth in these regions,” the study’s abstract states. “In this study, we reveal that the decreases in aerosols over Europe and the United States have contributed to significant decreases in TCs over the Southern Hemisphere as well as increases in TCs over the North Atlantic, whereas the increases in aerosols in South and East Asia have exerted substantial decreases in TCs over the western North Pacific.” NOAA scientist Hiroyuki Murakami, the author of the paper, claims that the aerosol pollution has masked some of the worst effects of global warming. The absence of those airborne particulates allows the jet stream to move further north, which reduces shear factors that have mitigated TCs in the Atlantic Ocean. It’s a good news/bad news scenario, according to Murakami. “Air pollution is a big environmental risk to human health and we have made great strides in reducing health risks by reducing particulate air pollution,” Murakami said. But reducing air pollution does not always decrease the risk of hazards from tropical cyclones. The study postulates that the effect of aerosol cooling may be one-third to one-half the effect of warming from greenhouse gases, but is likely twice as effective in reducing TC intensity. Should the aerosol activity remain low, as it is now, and greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, the resulting warmer water will lead to greater hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean.“That’s why the Atlantic has gone pretty much crazy since the mid-90s and why it was so quiet in the 70s and 80s,” said Jim Kossin, a climate and hurricane specialist with the risk assessment company Climate Service, Inc. Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, high amounts of aerosol pollution from Asian nations, particularly China, have kept TC activity 14 percent lower in the 21st century. This new study appears to fly in the face of another study that NOAA contributed to, which claims there has really been no large-scale increase in hurricane activity over the last 170 years. That study shows that any perceived increase in hurricanes can be largely explained by a substantial increase in monitoring capability. “Due to changes in observing practices, severe inhomogeneities exist in this database, complicating the assessment of long-term changes. In particular, there has been a substantial increase in monitoring capacity over the past 170 years, so that the probability that a HU (Atlantic Hurricane) is observed is substantially higher in the present than early in the record,” claims the study from researchers at NOAA, Princeton, the University of Iowa, and Utah State. Of course, the answer to more severe hurricanes is not to place more particulate matter (pollution) into the atmosphere. “Air pollution is a major killer, so reducing emissions is critical no matter what happens with the number of cyclones,” said Kristie Ebi, a public health professor at the University of Washington. So, what is the solution? Just live with bigger and more frequent hurricanes? It is possible that the conclusion of this study — that certain particulate matter in the atmosphere may lead to fewer hurricanes — could lead to a risky globalist geoengineering scheme touted by the United Nations, in which reflective aerosol sulfate material is released into the atmosphere. In theory, the reflective sulfate material would then mimic the way that volcanic ash clouds cool the planet.

The Federal government needs to display that they understand this. They owe it to our producers.” Ontario’s Lisa Thompson said after the meeting, “Provinces were disappointed by the lack of flexibility and consultation regarding the federal target.” However, some Canadian officials insist farmers will “embrace” the climate change policy. From theFederal minister Marie-Claude Bibeau called the government’s target ambitious but claims it’s one that farmers will embrace.“I’m meeting with many farmers in the field.

A nose as long as the trucker‘s convoy.” - Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. When thousands of truckers drove toward Ottawa in protest against the vaccine mandates, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described them as “the small fringe minority” holding “unacceptable views.” As the movement gained momentum and the truckers were joined and cheered on by scores of their compatriots objecting to Canada’s regime of Covid oppression, Trudeau implied that they were racists and Nazis. This he added on top of his earlier characterization of those who object to his policies as misogynists, science deniers, purveyors of misinformation and conspiracy theorists. By doing this he followed the standard line of the woke elites when dealing with those who do not want to go along with their de-humanizing and exploitative agendas. Rather than meeting the other side in rational discussion, they simply hurl insults that are void of any substance. “Racist,” “Nazi,” “conspiracy theorist,” and “misogynist” are their slurs of choice. It does not matter to them that such characterizations are baseless. Their wanton abuse of language and truth shows just how pathetic and detached from reality the elitists really are. Trudeau’s tirades could not be more laughable or absurd. That the unfolding protests have nothing to do with racism or Nazism or misogyny or science-denial is glaringly obvious to everyone with the eyes to see. What the protesters are standing up against is their government’s Covid chicanery, which has been among the most repressive in the western world. Lockdowns, curfews, travel bans, injections and boosters forced via onerous ID passports, police harassment: this has been Canadians’ experience in the past twenty-four months. And when people finally rise against their oppression, Trudeau resorts to calling them names which bear no relation to who these people are or what they are asking for. What Canada needs is a true leader and not some little weaselly dictator like Justin Trudeau. One perceptive lady told me the other day that Trudeau seems to her like someone who should model underwear. The lady was not trying to be funny; she was speaking in earnest. I was struck by the aptness of her observation and how it seems to have captured something essential about the man. Trying to picture it, he would be a very good candidate for this kind of role in these Covidic times.Whether Trudeau decides to pursue this line of work after he is done with politics remains to be seen. But while he remains in office, one thing is certain: like most of the rest of his globalist comrades, he is a reality-challenged demagogue who is tone-deaf to the concerns and suffering of common people. In the last couple of years, these establishment elitists have shown themselves to be ruthless liars who manipulate by false narratives whose aim is to enlarge their own power and wealth. The fact that their narratives keep falling apart does not deter them in the least. Do you want some recent examples? What about the Great Covid narrative? Do you remember how we were told that Covid was a plague that posed a grave threat to everyone, and that it would wipe out a sizeable portion of mankind unless drastic measure were taken? Well, it turned that Covid poses no real threat to children and young people and that the infection survival rate for healthy individuals of productive age is about 99.7 percent. It has also emerged that the death toll of Covid was vastly overstated. In the United Kingdom, for example, it came to light that it was seventeen thousand people that actually perished of this illness rather than one hundred and fifty thousand as was originally claimed by British authorities. We are talking here about an exaggeration factor of nearly 1000 percent. Do you remember how very fun the months’ long lockdowns were? Look at this recent headline from the UK Daily Mail: ""Lockdowns, school closures and limiting gatherings only reduced COVID mortality by 0.2% at 'enormous economic and social costs', study finds"" And what about the wonderful vaccine narrative? If you still remember, we were told that the Covid vaccines were perfectly safe and effective. The effectiveness numbers that were thrown about were 94 or 95 percent. We now know just how true those claims were. Only a few months after launching the worldwide vaccination crusade, they told us that the original injections did not quite work as advertised and that we needed a booster to keep us safe. But as luck would have it, a few months after getting boostered they told us that the booster did not really work either and that we needed another booster. The result is that now we have quadruple injectees in our midst. And even though they have been needled through and through, they are not protected either. It turns out that the boosters that were necessary to boost the first boosters do not work against Omicron. This is a real pity, because Omicron just happens to be everywhere as the world’s predominant strain. It is the testimony to the seemingly infinite bungling capacity of our ruling elites that having injected and boostered the majority of their populations, most Western countries are now posting unprecedented infection loads. Astonishingly enough, the new infection records are much higher now than they were in the pre-vaccine stage of the pandemic. Needless to say, it was only recently that the bungling Justin Trudeau claimed that the vaccines “are the only way out of this pandemic” and all of those who were refusing to take them were “science deniers” (and racists, of course). One only wants to ask the hapless Prime Minister: How are the shots working out for you, sir? Injected and boostered, he himself comes down with Covid. His predicament is not unique. Scores of other multiply jabbed Canadians are being mass infected with the virus. It is a fact that those who took the injections are now more likely to test positive than those who refused to submit themselves to the experimental mRNA injectables. Do you still remember when Fauci and Co. told us that if only 60 percent of the population would get these “very effective” injections we would acquire herd immunity, conquer the pandemic and go back to normal? Do you see how the globalists’ narratives keep collapsing one after another? It was under the guise of their false narratives that the global elites have terrorized the populations, siphoned wealth from the middle class and small business, crashed the economy and ruined countless lives. They have destroyed lives by bankrupting people financially, psychologically and by their deadly injections which have already killed hundreds of thousands across the world. Tragically, the list of victims will only grow in the months and years ahead as the onerous spike proteins which the vaccinators injected into people’s bodies continue wreaking their havoc. Many people had been so terrorized and confused by their rulers’ lies that they were unable to grasp what was happening. Now, however, they are increasingly waking up and rising in protest. These are, of course, the same people whom the elitists like Trudeau call racists, misogynists, Nazis, conspiracy theorists, etc. Undeterred by the Covid-vaccinal disaster they have wrought, the elitists are in the process of moving on to another narrative under which they hope to continue their regime of self-enrichment and oppression. Consider this recent headline from The Hill: ""Coming soon: Climate lockdowns?"" So now we are apparently in transition from one “emergency” to another. The man-made climate change narrative, however, is about as true as the Covid and the vaccine ones . . . [SNIP]","Justin Trudeau Shows How Manipulative and Pathetic the Global ""Elites"" Are"

The latest hysterical moral panic requiring ever more intense levels of control freak technocracy and safetyism has been unveiled; It’s hot in summer. Yes, really. Despite the fact that the UK has experienced a relatively mild summer so far, clickbait mainstream news outlets are pressing the panic button in anticipation of high temperatures across the country this weekend. The UK Met Office, a notorious peddler of climate change propaganda, is front and center warning of “extreme heat” over the next few days, declaring it to be a “national emergency.” To others, however, it’s known as the middle of July, or summer.Strangely, the same people who cry “weather isn’t indicative of climate change” when skeptics point out record cold temperatures suddenly assert that in fact it is whenever it gets hot because they say so. More inquiring minds have noted that, yes indeed, it has been hot in summer before, but the colors used to represented temperatures have been made more scary.Meanwhile, it’s been revealed that much of the panic is based on manipulated temperature readings that are taken next to airport runways with hot jet engines and tarmac. “About one half of all land surface temperature measurements used to show global warming and promote the command-and-control Net Zero agenda are taken near or adjacent to airport runways,” the Daily Skeptic.“Emeritus Professors William Happer and Richard Lindzen recently told the U.S. Government that over the last several decades, “NASA and NOAA have been fabricating temperature data to argue that rising CO2 levels have led to the hottest year on record”. These false and manipulated data were said to be an “egregious violation of scientific method”.” As we previously highlighted , technocrats are now calling for, and in some countries implementing, climate lockdowns in the name of saving the environment. Meanwhile, in the real world, Arctic sea ice is just 3 per cent below its 30 year average. As we reported last year, one of the authors of the United Nations IPCC report who focused on “extreme” consequences of man-made global warming lauded the fact that “people are starting to get scared” about climate change and that this would “affect the way they vote.” However, doomsday climate change prophecies have been proven spectacularly wrong time and time again.

But anyone who still believes that these high-ranking politicians have any real power over national or international affairs, and that by replacing them with other politicians will solve economic or social problems, is not living in reality in terms of who controls the affairs of this world. Money, or financial power, rules the world, and since the start of the industrial age that began after WW II, that group of people at the top who occupy the leadership of banks, financial institutions and large corporations has dramatically shrunk, and the time has come for them to make their ultimate move, to take over the world’s financial system and implement a New World Order where any resemblance to individual liberty and principles of democracy are completely swept away for totalitarianism and tyranny., their top banks employ as many software engineers to spy on their employees as Google and Microsoft employ , and they have gotten away with rigging the markets illegally for so long now, that they are now in the process of doing away with Wall Street altogether and implementing a new national stock exchange called MEMX , where people will work remotely instead of on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. Technology, and I am defining “technology” here as the advent of the PC (personal computer) and public use of the Internet (which was developed by the military) in the 1980s and early 1990s, is by and large what has allowed them to gain so much power, but that technology may also be their Achilles heal and downfall but that is a topic for another day and another article. Most of the public is aware of the World Economic Forum (WEF) where many of these Globalists gather, but Brandon Smith has published an article today exposing another organization that is less well known, and possibly even more influential, the “The idea that there is an agenda for global government among the financial and political elites of the world has long been called a “conspiracy theory” within the mainstream and the establishment media. And sadly, even when you can convince people to look at and accept the evidence that banking institutions and certain politicians work together for their own purposes, many folks will STILL not entertain the notion that the ultimate goal of these power mongers is one-world empire. They just can’t wrap their heads around such a thing. People will say that the establishment is driven by greed alone and that their associations are fragile and based only on individual self interest. They will say that crisis events and shifts in social and political trends are random, not the product of deliberate engineering. They will say that elitists will never be able to work together because they are too narcissistic, etc. All of these arguments are a coping mechanism for the public to deal with evidence they cannot otherwise refute. When the facts become concrete and the powers-that-be admit to their schemes openly, some people will revert to confused denial. They don’t want to believe that organized evil on such a scale could actually be real. If it did, then everything they thought they knew about the world might be wrong. For many years the agenda for global governance was only whispered about within elitist circles, but every once in a while one of them would speak aloud in public about it. Perhaps out of arrogance or perhaps because they felt the time was right to ease the populace into accepting the possibility. Whenever they did mention it, they called it the “New World Order.” World leaders from George HW Bush to Barack Obama to Joe Biden to Gordon Brown to Tony Blair and beyond have all given speeches talking about the “New World Order.” Money and political elites like George Soros and Henry Kissinger have mentioned the NWO incessantly over the years.The “NWO” has since changed names multiple times as the public grows increasingly wise to the conspiracy. It’s been called the Multilateral World Order, the 4 th Industrial Revolution, the “Great Reset,” etc. The names change but the meaning is always the same. In the past two years in the face of extensive global crisis events the “new order” establishment globalists have been talking about has arrived, and with almost no fanfare or mention in the mainstream media. The beginnings of global government already exist, and it’s called the “Council For Inclusive Capitalism.” Lately, many analysts myself included have been highly focused on the World Economic Forum and their role in the global government agenda. Mainly because WEF head Klaus Schwab is such a loudmouth and he can’t help but talk about future plans for centralization. As I have noted in past articles, the elites within the WEF got way too excited about the covid pandemic, thinking that they had the perfect crisis to implement numerous globalist policies in the form of the Great Reset. As it turned out, covid was nowhere near as deadly as they initially predicted during Event 201 , and the public was not as submissive and compliant as they had hoped we would be. The WEF let the cat out of the bag too soon.So, onward we go, with crisis after crisis like dominoes falling until we get to the one event that they think will drive the masses to accept world governance. And while the WEF is regularly attended by top level globalists, they are more of a high level think-tank, the Council for Inclusive Capitalism appears to be about implementation rather than theory. The founder of the group is Lynn Forester de Rothschild, member of the infamous Rothschild Dynasty that has long been monetarily involved in influencing governments for generations. Pope Francis and the Vatican publicly aligned with the council in 2020, and one of the primary narratives of the CIC is that all religions must unite with the leaders of capital to build a society and an economy that is “fair for all.” This mission statement is rather familiar, as it echoes the goals of the WEF and its concept of the “Shared Economy” : A system in which you will own nothing, have no privacy, borrow everything, be completely reliant on the government for your survival and you will “like it.” In other words, the purpose of “inclusive capitalism” is to con the masses into accepting a rebranded version of communism. The promise will be that you won’t have to worry anymore about your economic future, but the cost will be your freedom.Members of the CIC have included: Mastercard, Allianz, Dupont, the UN, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA), CalPERS, BP, Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, Visa, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, Mark Carney, the Treasurer of the State of California and many more companies around the world. The list is extensive, but what it represents is a kind of corporate led government with a congress of corporate representatives mixed with pliable political leaders. One of the top missions of the CIC has been to change our economic models to “promote equity and inclusion.” Hilariously, proponents of the CIC argue that “too much wealth has been accumulated into the hands of too few people and this proves that existing capitalism does not work, yet THEY are the very people that rigged the system to centralize that wealth into THEIR HANDS. They aren’t “capitalists,” they are an aristocracy. Do you really think that these people are going to build a whole new system that doesn’t continue to benefit them? If you have ever wondered why the Pope has been pushing woke ideology, climate alarmism and one world religion rhetoric in conflict with traditional Christian doctrine, this is why He’s following the dictates of the CIC. Another mission of the CIC is to enforce carbon controls and taxation in the name of “climate change” with the purpose of reaching “net-zero” emissions . As we all know, net zero carbon will be impossible without a complete upheaval of our economy and industry, along with the deaths of billions of people in the process. It is an unattainable scenario, which is why it is perfect for the globalists. Humans are the enemy of the Earth, they claim, so we need to let the elites control our every action to ensure we don’t destroy the planet and ourselves, and the process will never end because there will always be carbon emissions to deal with. Members of the CIC, including the head of Bank of America , openly suggest that they don’t actually need governments to cooperate in order to meet their goals. They say corporations can implement most social engineering without political aid. In other words, it is the every definition of “shadow government” A massive corporate cabal that works in tandem to implement social changes without any oversight. As noted, we’ve already seen this with the spread of woke ideology by hundreds if not thousands of corporations working as a hive.Is the CIC the final form of global government? No, probably not. But, it is the beginning of it; a government by corporations and money elites for corporations and money elites. It bypasses all political representation, all checks and balances and all voter participation. It is conglomerates and their partners making decisions for our society unilaterally and in a centralized fashion. And, since big business acts as if they are separate from government rather than partners with government, they can claim they are allowed to do whatever they please. However, with corporations and globalists increasingly showing their true colors and acting as if they should be in charge, the public must hold them accountable as if they are part of government. And if they are found to be authoritarian and corrupt, they must be overthrown like any other political dictatorship.

Connington (1880-1947) Alfred Walter Stewart was a successful academic chemist who also found the time to write four chemistry textbooks plus a series of detective novels, a few other novels and some short stories under the pseudonym J.J. Connington. I don’t know much about old Alfred, but he comes across as a dry old stick and maybe something of a misogynist. It’s an interesting quote though – there is no true progress unless our general outlook is altered. Yet as we know, progress has come to include certain supposedly science-based political doctrines which must not be altered. The climate change narrative being one of the most obvious. Suppose we apply Stewart’s quote to the political reality of the climate narrative. It would run something like this – there is no true progress unless our general outlook is unaltered. A sarcastic way of putting it I know, and the faithful would never put like that. Yet floods, droughts, hot, cold, snow, rain, drizzle, grey skies or blue skies all are supposedly consistent with climate doom – scientifically consistent. Genuine progress in orthodox climate science has not been possible for decades because its general outlook has to remain unaltered.It’s the bureaucratic way we see it in action every time our UK government and its acolytes push the Net Zero narrative. It doesn’t matter if it is not possible for the UK to make even a theoretical difference to global temperatures. Once Net Zero had been settled at government level it ossified. From that point it has not been possible to make genuine progress in UK energy research and development because our general outlook must remain unaltered. Yet as Stewart pointed out many decades ago, it is characteristic of genuine progress that our general outlook in the observational and experimental sciences should be altered. If it isn’t altered, then the progress we have supposedly made is fake. We could take this further. When a political establishment recruits any profession to its ranks, then progress within that profession is curtailed or even halted altogether. Journalism could be a topical example.",Fake Progress

Rose is an Investigative Journalist specialised in Organised Political Crime in Germany and an editor of BRAVE NEW EUROPE A very odd thing happened the other day. The minister president of the north German federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommen, Manuela Schwesig, posted a message on twitter showing the parliament of her state illuminated in Yellow and Blue. The text read “Solidarity with Ukraine. An important signal from our parliament”. The response by Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, in another act of courage typical of the Ukrainian people, wrote in response “Your hypocrisy makes me vomit”. Schwesig, who is a German social democratic version of Ursula von der Leyen, has been an important enabler and poster-girl for the Russian-German gas pipeline Nordstream 2, which would have entered Germany in her state. To get past US sanctions her government even created a foundation to acquire, manage, own, provide or let land, tools and machines to enable the completion of the pipeline. The ploy was an obvious scheme to protect German interests in cornering a great part of the EU gas industry in order to lead in the blue hydrogen energy (gas is burnt to create CO2 free hydrogen, but produces an enormous amount of CO2 in the process) market. A few weeks ago she was provided support by Germany’s new minister for economics and environmental protection, Robert Habeck of the Greens, who pushed through labelling the fossil fuel (Russian) gas as “green” in the EU taxonomy. Maybe Ukraine’s German ambassador could still remember a similar incident. Following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014. The German industrial “champion” Siemens sold four gas turbines to produce electricity to Russia in 2015 and 2016. These were then installed in the Crimea, which was subject to sanctions from the European Union. The trick was to unload them in the Russian port of Taman, bordering Crimea. They were then reloaded and transferred to Crimea, fulfilling a promise by Putin to provide the peninsula with an autarkic electricity provider. Of course Siemens claimed it had no idea that this would happen and had not broken any laws. These affairs are typical for the German government and corporations: bullying, cheating, and bribing to promote economic growth and corporate profits. As EU hegemon this is never challenged. It is no coincidence that Volkswagen’s diesel cheating devices were first prosecuted in the United States, which is not beholden to German financial power, although the ruse was an open secret in Europe for years. In 2010 Germany’s chancellor at that time, Angela Merkel, had even travelled to Los Angeles, and accompanied by the state Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, tried to intimidate Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, to stop her from coming down so hard on German diesels. The ensuing US investigation resulted in tens of billions in fines and damages and a number of Volkswagen managers – up to now innocent in the eyes of the German justice system – who cannot visit the US for fear of landing in prison for years. Then there is the Deutsche Bank, which has had to face innumerable prosecutions and paid billions in fines in the US until Donald Trump, whose loans from Deutsche Bank are now under investigation, became president and apparently intervened behind the scenes. Or Germany’s internet finance champion Wirecard, which was protected by the German government, central bank, and public prosecutors over years, including the same public prosecutors instead investigating Financial Times journalists who were exposing the fraud. In 2020 Wirecard collapsed, as predicted by the FT. Germany is investing its energy protecting the politicians and prominent businessmen involved in the scandal. There are even stubborn rumours that the German intelligence agencies assisted one of the Wirecard managers to flee the country and go into hiding. As the USA has demonstrated extensively, there are no laws for a hegemon, nor any rights it needs to respect. The same is true for Germany in the EU. As EU hegemon Germany has led the EU into a number or crises, which are now coming to a climax. It has not only discouraged investment in renewable energy in Germany, but throughout the EU, protecting its coal industry and nascent blue hydrogen with tooth and nail. It has protected its vehicle industry, so crucial to its economy, by sabotaging directly and indirectly almost all EU laws concerning cleaning up the environmental benchmarks of the EU vehicle industry, including the pretence that hybrid cars were green technology to enable maintaining their high sales of expensive, high CO2/NOX SUVs. It has made a shambles of most EU member states finances, resulting in misery and suffering. Germany has done what all hegemons do, made everyone else pay for its entitlements, as we saw so clearly with Greece. Behind the EU’s veneer of liberal utopianism is cold blooded corporate power and its champion is Germany. The German political class is not doing this for its own citizens. Decades ago it decoupled from its people and dedicated itself to supporting German corporations, and these decoupled from Germany to maximise profits internationally. The German mercantilist model has been imposed upon the whole of the European Union – Germany’s European Union. All the real problems facing Europe, economic, environmental, levelling up, poverty and inequality, refugees, workers rights and many more have not been solved, but kicked down the road while maintaining the neo-liberal corporate diktat. The symbol this for policy is former German chancellor Angela Merkel. Now it appears the road is ending and there are still no solutions in sight, just the same old make the wealthy wealthier and let everyone else poorer pay for this – and of course claiming that Germany has not broken any laws, most of which they make. Just when it looked like the Germans were going to tighten the screws of austerity again, forcing the ECB to raise interest rates and EU nations to slash their budgets, after they had opened the financial flood gates to protect the interests of European corporations in the Covid crisis, the war in Ukraine has brought that show to a close. The Germans and EU political class are scrambling with massive virtue signalling, as did Ms Schwesig, and is doing everything to salvage EU corporations by exempting Russian fossil fuels, agricultural products, and diamonds (to Antwerp) from sanctions in Europe, or permitting the export of Italian of luxury goods to Russian oligarchs who may be forbidden from visiting Europe, at home in Russia. The same is true of the EU’s “committent” to Swift sanctions, where all Russian banks that were critical for EU business with Russia were not included. This has led to one of the most absurd political situations imaginable and shows how entangled the EU is in the web of German lies and prevarications. With its pretensions of self-righteousness as a champion of the Ukrainian people, it is simultaneously financing the Russian war machine that is massacring the Ukrainians. But none of this hypocrisy is going to spare the people of Europe true hardship. Renewable energy was not just about climate change, but also emancipating Europe from dependence upon nations like Russia, the Gulf States, and the USA. But any economic change in Europe means upsetting the business status quo, which means the economic system built into the EU centred on the German economy and corporate profits. It is to this status quo that Germany and the EU are clinging, as we saw in the Covid crisis. The answer to “build back better” was green nuclear energy and gas and kicking the can down the road to insure corporate interests. The citizens of Europe will now be paying a high price for the failure of their political class. What we shall be seeing in the very near future is an increasing rate of inflation due to rocketing energy and food prices, a further breakdown of supply chains, and major fall outs in the financial and corporate sectors. While many are hoping that there might now be real structural change in EU economic policy, it will end the same as the past two financial crises, with central banks and governments showering corporations with money. Germany has already shown the way. After repeating there is no funds for a robust renewable energy programme, 100 billion euros are now to be invested in military hardware and the usual corporations who are their clientele. Instead of becoming serious about energy independence and stopping climate change, in the name of softening the current crisis, European politicians are proposing, of course due to the war, watering down even further or even postponing goals set to achieve just this, to protect corporate profits. One does not know where to begin with the possible fallouts due to the crisis coming our way. The semi-slave labourers form Eastern Europe who are carted to Western Europe as cheap labour may also be in for a shock when they discover that Ukrainian refugees are willing to harvest cucumbers, slaughter chickens, and cut up meat for half the price. We may even see true solidarity in action as EU governments exempt Ukrainian refugees from the minimum wage so that they can find work. It will be interesting if the appreciable increase in the minimum wage promised by the new German coalition occurs or is postponed due to the war and high inflation, although by then it may not even cover the real increase in the cost of living, much less provide some sort of progress in reducing inequality. There are so many consequences facing the EU from this war, which they could have prevented, not to mention reducing the impact. The European political class and the corporations they are beholden produce an etheric field of smoke and mirrors, a parallel reality. They have mainstream media supporting them. War fever and hypocrisy will initially do the rest. But this time kicking the can down the road may not function. However after decades of having policy dictated to them by corporations that is all the European political class knows how to do, beyond lying, prevaricating, and moral posturing. This is nowhere more evident than with the current government of Germany: a bumbling chancellor (the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz); a foreign minister (Annalena Baerbock of the Greens) who campaigned on getting tough with Russia (obviously having not the slightest glimmer of the consequences, as we are now seeing); an economics minister who wants to prove that the Greens are just as loyal to corporations as the other mainstream parties, and, a finance minister (the Liberal Christian Lindner) who keeps serving up neo-liberal nostrums and whose party’s motto appears to be “Corporations: you pay us and leave the dirty work and lying to us”. Add to this that the president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, comes out of the same political stall. Not the sort of team you want leading you at this moment – and they will determine EU policy. As Wolfgang Munchau noted; The EU is cheering on the Ukrainian side from a safe distance, watching from warm living rooms, heated by Russian gas. When many EU citizens no longer can afford heating gas, be it from Russia or the US, what then? Support us and become part of a medium that takes responsibility for society.

9764,tapnewswire-280585d3a85fbf37843c869fabb905aa,2022-01-31 21:26:00,"Wokeism has been described by its critics as the omnipresent use of race—and to a lesser extent, gender—to replace meritocracy and thus ensure equality of result. What follows from implementing that ideology are reparatory actions to reward those of the present by atoning for the injustices done to others in the past. Some see it as an update of 1960s cultural Marxism fads. Others scoff that it is just a return to 1980s-style political correctness. Still more see it as the logical successor to 1990s-type race, class, and gender obsessions—albeit with a shriller and more dangerous Jacobin, Soviet, and Maoist twist. Wokeism’s hysteria also invites comparisons to the Salem witch trials and McCarthyism. But few have described wokeism as the cruel creed that it is. Wokeism’s natural logic is to destroy the lives of people of both genders, of all races, and—if need be—those of every age, all to leverage an otherwise unworkable ideological agenda. It is nihilist and destroys everything it touches. It tears apart foes and friends alike, whether by fueling media-driven hatred of Donald Trump or faux-deification of the disaster that is now Joe Biden. Woke’s Victims. Defunding law enforcement and defaming police resulted in record numbers of murders in 12 U.S. cities. A wave of violent crime is even hitting America’s suburbs. Without much fear of arrest, indictment, conviction, and incarceration, emboldened violent career criminals for the past year have robbed, assaulted, and killed the innocent with impunity. The victims at the bus stop, the subway, or in the furniture store do not seem to warrant media or progressive attention, much less sympathy. They are the ignored—the unnamed, and the forgotten collateral damage from the grand experiment of redefining crime as a social construct. The guilty are the elite academics, activists, and billionaires like George Soros who are untouched by what they birthed. We have all seen videos of the vast expanse of flotsam and jetsam strewn by train thieves along the Union Pacific tracks in Los Angeles. Yet the Wild West mess is still more than just the concrete manifestations of Los Angeles County district attorney George Gascón’s unhinged efforts to excuse criminals from legal consequences. The packages thrown along the ground by thugs and gangsters represent, among other things, lost COVID-19 test results of the ill. Presumably, they unknowingly are waiting still by the window for the delivery of results that never arrive. The package in the dirt was, perhaps, a key tractor part eagerly awaited, in vain, by the broke farmer in the Central Valley. The mess included the life-saving medicines shipped to the sick that disappeared. And our elected leaders did what in response? Governor Gavin Newsom apologized for using the insensitive word “gangs” to describe those who plunder, loot, and trash railcars. Always In Search of Targets. It is a cruel thing to indoctrinate children with the lie that they are innately guilty of oppression due to their skin color. One accurate definition of racism is collective ill-treatment of an individual due to his innate appearance—on the pretext that such bias is deserved, given the target is deemed mentally, spiritually, or morally inferior because of said traits. But that, in a nutshell, is the essence of critical race theory: the destruction of all human traits and unique characteristics, as demonized individuals are reduced to stereotyped, faceless members of a collective. For over a half-century, female athletes have sought to achieve parity in society’s attitudes to sports. Title IX forced universities to ensure rough equality for both female and male sports. But the woke effort to redefine transitioning biological males as identical to biological women will assuredly destroy the life work of thousands of pioneer athletes. Ironically, the sexist woke movement has allowed men to take hormones and undergo surgery to become females—even as their immutable skeleton frames, muscularity, or organ characteristics ensure an unfair and asymmetrical contest. The lives of thousands of young female athletes will likely be diminished. Each sprinter, every swimmer, and all female pole-vaulters will now inevitably at some future date have a rendezvous with career implosion—defined by losing to a transgendered female/biological male. Records are being rewritten, the very nature of individual women’s sports changed, and soon there will no longer remain an idea of “women’s sports” at all. The Forgotten Broken Eggs of the Woke Omelet. The green wokeists postulate that they are saving lives by radical efforts to restrict gas and oil production, to raise fuel prices. They want to force Americans to buy high-priced alternative sources of wind- and solar-generated power and battery-powered cars. But away from the faculty lounge, millions of Americans are colder and less mobile this winter, paying far more to heat their homes and to drive to work. Most of the woke climate change activists rarely see the poor trying to empty their purses to scrounge combinations of cash and credit cards to leverage over $100 to fill their cars’ gas tanks. Tesla drivers might be the architects of last year’s war on carbon fuels. But real-life victims pay for their piety—those who have no such options to buy high-priced electric cars. For the cosmopolitan woke, the border is many things: a mere xenophobic construct, a racist barrier, a nationalist tic. But the thousands who live near the Mexican border see their homes and farms overrun with drug traffickers—and during a pandemic thousands of unvaccinated and possibly sick illegal aliens. They suffer firsthand from daily violence as all security disappears. For the American poor, who rely on government health clinics and state entitlements, the influx of thousands of illegal aliens into their communities becomes a zero-sum game. The more noncitizens put demands on such already oversubscribed services, the fewer citizens there are who will have access to quality care. The woke lecture that colleges and universities must now go beyond their former de facto racial quotas for admissions and hiring, already mostly based on proportional representation and disparate impact. But now a sort of reparations system emerges. It is what the Left itself used to call in derision “overrepresentation.” Equity in our Orwellian world is not equality, but payback. Again, it is the idea of making the current generation pay for the supposed sins of the long dead of centuries past. Aside from the destruction of merit by the substitution of racial criteria, millions from a discarded generation will have doors slammed on their careers—simply because of the color of their skin. And they will never forget that. The woke do not even make the effort to admit that class matters as much as, or more than, race. By doing so, they doom millions of poor white and Asian students, who managed in poverty to achieve excellent grades and test scores, from being admitted to top-tier schools. Their actual achievement, despite their absence of wealthy, college-educated, or well-connected parents, means little. Once a morally bankrupt society—for naïve, utopian, or ignoble reasons—begins to calibrate graduation ceremonies, dorm space, roommate selection, achievement, and grading standards based on race, then it not only will lose its standard of living, but it will deserve to. And it may have a future date with the violence of Rwanda, Iraq, or the Balkans. Power, Not “Equity,” Is the Creed. In sum, wokeness is not about kindness, equality, fairness, or morality. It is the power agenda of the elite of all races. For differing reasons, they rig the game in their own interests, without a care about who suffers. Rich white people assume that they possess the money, the influence, the networking skills, and the connections to navigate around the very exclusionary rules they make for others. For them, there are seldom costs. But they win apparent psychological gain at feeling spiritually superior while driving a Range Rover. They get high on the sense of power they wield to engineer the lives of millions deemed less important than they. And to the degree they feel guilty about their own monopoly of wealth and leisure, such transient superficial remorse is alleviated by abstract caring for the “other.” If they can ensure that 50 percent of TV commercials highlight African Americans, then they worry little about the nation’s existential crisis of 800 blacks murdered in Chicago last year. And no such television execs have a clue—or likely a concern—about how to stop it. The woke take out a medieval contract that all their material indulgences can be balanced by virtue-signalling caring for the less fortunate—although always at someone else’s expense. Woke = Wealthy Careerists. And for the millions of the affluent, elite nonwhite? The resurgence of racial obsessions conveniently destroys the old idea of class, even though now it is the far more precise calibration of inequality. For all the woke talk about “constructs” of gender, race is somehow alone exempted and declared innate, definable, and immutable. One’s appearance becomes the permanent victimized refuge—even of NBA multibillionaires and billionaire rappers alike. A Ward Churchill or Elizabeth Warren can desperately seek to leverage a career in becoming Native American, apparently as if they were almost trapped in their own white bodies. Yet they can still not manage to construct such assumed identities in the manner of Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner. If race is now the sole immutable barometer of who is a victim, who a victimizer, then LeBron James, Jay-Z, Kayne West, Chris Rock, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey are always to be among the eternally oppressed. The enormous influence, power, status, and wealth they wield never negates their victimhood, despite a nation three generations into affirmative action. In the immoral calculus of woke, the poor white or Southeast Asian offspring of poorly paid high-school dropouts constitute “the privileged.” And a multimillionaire racist like the TV anchorwoman Joy Reid claims to be the perpetual victim, not the inner-city African American retiree who in 2021 has lost local police protection. No wonder the woke elite and the affluent leftists fixate on race, given they are now the ruling class. Otherwise, their own privilege would be the obvious target of the once-beloved “Revolution.” So, they fear that by their own prior left-wing standards, they too could end up on the wrong side of their moral Maginot Line. Wokeism’s obsessions with ferreting out “white privilege” are a way for rich people to head off (so to speak) the fate of Marie Antoinette. Totalitarian Wokeism. A final note. We know wokeism is both contrary to human nature and antithetical to democracy and constitutional government. Without public support, it has instead embraced an entire array of cruel, Soviet, and Maoist means to achieve its own self-interested ends. Woke talk about “racists” eerily emulates Soviet boilerplate about “counterrevolutionaries.” Today’s wokeist spouts things that could come right out of the mouth of the novelist Boris Pasternak’s character",Wokeism is a cruel cult—created by and for the careerist benefit of the privileged.

To be more accurate, I find the thinking and emotion around vaccines endlessly fascinating... and often quite disturbing. They have become, what we in the UK call 'national treasures.' A national treasure is someone, such as Dame Judi Dench, or Sir David Attenborough. We laugh at their little jokes, we forgive them any possible weakness, we treat their statements as carrying a great and solemn weight. They have moved to a sainted realm. If, for example, someone was to say about David Attenborough. ' God, what a terrible bore. Time he was put into a nursing home, and stopped moaning on about Climate Change... ' This statement would not, I can guarantee, be met with Universal approval. Moving on ...'The preparation of Galene was simple in that its ingredients were free of fractional measures. Four vipers cut down small were placed in a solution of sal ammoniac, about one gallon, to which were added nine specified herbs and Attic wine, together with five fresh squills also cut down small. The pot was covered with clay and set upon a fire. When the vapour came out of the four small holes left in the clay seal, dark and turgid, the heat had reached the vipers and they were cooked. The pot was left to cool for a night and day. The roasted matter was taken out and pounded until all was reduced to powder. After 10 days the powder was ready for the next stage of manufacture. At the final stage the prescribed quantities of 55 herbs previously prepared by various processes, along with the prescribed quantity of squill and viper flesh powder (48 drachms), were added to hedychium, long pepper and poppy juice (all at 24 drachms); eight herbs including cinnamon and opobalsam (all at 12 drachms); 18 herbs including myrrh, black and white pepper and turpentine resin (at 6 drachms); 22 others and then Lemnian earth and roasted copper (at 4 drachms each); bitumen and castoreum (the secretion of beaver); 150 drachms of honey and 80 drachms of vetch meal. The concoction took some 40 days to prepare, after which the process of maturation began. Twelve years was considered by Galen the proper period to keep it before use. Galen records that the Emperor Marcus Aurelius consumed the preparation within 2 months of its being compounded without ill effect. Mithridatium was similar but contained fewer ingredients and no viper but did contain lizard! The other differences were that the opium content of Andromachus' theriac was higher than that of Mithridatium, which also differed in containing no Lemnian earth, copper or bitumen and 14 fewer herbal ingredients...' 1Simple to prepare ... I think I would prefer to make a bacon sandwich, thanks very much. Various formulations of mithridatium were painstakingly put together, in public, to ensure that no-one was cutting corners, by substituting newt for lizard - or some other such underhand substitutions. Yes, it was vitally important that mithridatium was made of pure unadulterated nonsense. No cut-price, corner-cutting nonsense here, thank you very much. It was then sold for a fortune. And people flocked to buy it. The manufacture of mithridatium, and its variants, went on from the second century BC to the end of the eighteenth century. Or, to frame this another way. The idea of creating a substance that contained small portions of various poisons, in order to allow the body to build up immunity, and fight off all illnesses and infections, has an extremely long history. All doctors in the mid to late eighteenth century would have been acutely aware of mithridatium, and its variants, and the thinking behind it. William Heberden, a famous UK physician, is the man we can most credit with attacking the idea of ' Mithridatium and Theriaca' . His pamphlet on the matter was written in 1745. He argued that it was all complete, unscientific, twaddle. Following this, and other attacks, the sales of Theriac mithridatium suffered a rapid decline. By the end of the eighteenth century Mithridatium had pretty much disappeared from the world. To the point whereby nowadays ninety-nine per cent of people - or more - have no idea that such a substance ever existed. Or how hugely significant it was. Let us move on a few years to 1796. A moment in time when an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps, was inoculated with ' matte r' from Sarah Nelms, a dairy-maid, who had cowpox. Three months later, the same boy was 'inoculated' with fresh 'matter' from a smallpox lesion - and no disease developed. Lucky boy. Not sure you would get that past the ethics committee today. ' I am fairly confident that he will not die of smallpox .. probably Yes, as mithridatism departed from this world, vaccination moved in to take up the available space - a different substance to protect against future illness. In truth, the idea of inoculating people with small amounts of smallpox 'matter' to help the body fight off a more serious infection had been around for some time before this. It was carried out in China, Africa, and the Ottoman empire perhaps for, hundreds of years. Although the idea that it is possible to have a 'small' inoculation with a deadly virus is interesting .... Do not try this at home. To me, the important point I am trying to make here, is that the underlying idea behind vaccination had been around for millennia. Vaccination was, in effect, a variation on the theme of mithridatism. However, the idea that a cow pox infection could protect against future smal lpox was new, and it was Jenner's idea. At least he made the most noise about it. Others claim it was Benjamin Jesty. Who knows? Success has a thousand authors, failure but one. I think I shall credit the milk maids instead. They had known for many years that if you got infected with cowpox, you were protected against smallpox. An observation that Jenner picked up on, then ran with. Good for him ...'... The record shows that it was there that Jenner heard a dairymaid say, ""I shall never have smallpox for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly pockmarked face."" In fact, it was a common belief that dairymaids were in some way protected from smallpox.' 2But, of course, at the time all this this was complete speculation and guesswork. When vaccination began no-one knew that there such things as bacteria, or viruses. No-one knew there was an immune system. No-one had the faintest idea about T-cells and B-cells and suchlike. Which leads to the question. What did Jenner actually think he was doing? How did he believe vaccination could possibly work? After all, he was experimenting with vaccination decades before germ theory had emerged. This happened in the late(r) nineteenth century. A time when Pasteur, John Snow and the like, finally managed to convince the medical profession that infectious diseases were not spread by Miasma - essentially nasty smelly stuff that floated about in the atmosphere. Instead, disease was spread by very small 'germs.' If Jenner did not know that germs existed, what did he think was causing smallpox? If it was via miasma, how would vaccination work? A part of me thinks that he must have believed that a physical agent, or some sort, was causing 'pox'. Otherwise, why would he scrape away at cowpox blisters to get 'stuff' off. He couldn't have believed he was transferring miasma from one person to another. Maybe he thought the miasma theory was complete nonsense but didn't dare point this out. Semmelweis certainly found out, to his cost, that trying to suggest infection could be passed on by physical contact was not well received. A Hungarian physician, he did some thinking, and research, on how infections were passed on. He recommended that it might be a good idea if doctors might just, possibly might, consider washing their hands after doing a post-mortem ... then helping women to deliver their babies. For which heresy, he ended up being flung into a lunatic asylum. He was later beaten to death by a warden. This was some forty years after Jenner began his experiments on vaccination. Yes, Semmelweis is now a very famous figure in the history of medicine, the 'saviour of mothers' but it didn't do him much good at the time. As you can probably tell, I find the development of medical thinking - indeed all scientific thinking - to be fascinating. Where do the ideas come from? At times I believe it is all complete luck. Good ideas, bonkers ideas, they all appear to be taken up with equal enthusiasm. All you need is a good tale and a charismatic promoter, then off you go.'It was not noisy prejudice that caused the work of Mendel to lie dead for thirty years, but the sheer inability of contemporary opinion to distinguish between a new idea and nonsense .' Wilfred TrotterWith vaccination though, there was no major new idea. There were two thousand years of Mithridatism to build on. Namely, use a small amount of a substance to create future immunity. A general concept that was, and remains, highly seductive to the human mind. With vaccination it just happened to be right. However, it could just as easily have been wrong. For example, the thinking behind mithridatism also underpins homeopathy. A concept that first came to Samuel Hahnemann. A doctor who obtained his medical degree in 1779. Yes, he was kicking around at very much the same time as Jenner.'Hahnemann believed that if a patient had an illness, it could be cured by giving a medicine which, if given to a healthy person, would produce similar symptoms of that same illness but to a slighter degree. Thus, if a patient was suffering from severe nausea, he was given a medicine which in a healthy person would provoke mild nausea. By a process he called 'proving', Hahnemann claimed to be able to compile a selection of appropriate remedies. This led to his famous aphorism, 'like cures like', which is often called the 'principle of similars'; and he cited Jenner's use of cowpox vaccination to prevent smallpox as an example.' 3It is said that the idea of homeopathy first popped into Hahnemann's head because he noted that quinine, in small doses, created similarly symptoms to malaria, although in a much milder form. So, he tried to use quinine to protect against malaria. Then he expanded the concept, to infinity and beyond. Mind you, the use of quinine to protect against malaria led to the creation of tonic water, to protect the British in India. This, in turn, led to the creation of gin and tonic. So, Hahnemann must be celebrated for this wonderous legacy, at least. Yes, for this, I can forgive him just about everything. And, of course, quinine does protect against malaria. If not that well. Oh, the delicious irony. Mithridatism: Ingestion of small doses of poisons to create immunity Homeopathy : Use of very small doses of a substance to create immunity/cure Vaccination: Deliberate infection, using small doses of an agent, to create immunity Mithridatism is gone; Homeopathy is mocked; Vaccination is venerated Imagine if, on the other hand, Jenner had decided to keep on using smallpox scrapings to try and prevent a later, more deadly smallpox infection. Maybe vaccination would never have happened, at all. Just to give one example of the problems with smallpox inoculation. In 1783, Prince Octavius, the youngest son of King George II was inoculated with the smallpox virus. He died soon after - of smallpox. Had King George then taken violently against 'vaccination' at this point, the entire idea may have died right then and there. At least in the UK. Instead, with Jenner came the crossroads. The point where mithridatism, homeopathy, and vaccination parted company. One works, the other two don't. This is because there is no such thing as a vanishingly small dose of an infection. You get infected, or you do not. The dose is pretty much irrelevant. Of course, what happens after infection can vary enormously. Some people get no symptoms, at all, others may die. The key point of difference with vaccination is that you are not giving a small dose of the infective agent - however vanishingly small. The point, the critical difference, is that you have to give 'something else' instead. Something other than the actual infective agent. This stimulates the immune system and leads to the creation of memory cells that will recognise a 'similar' agent in the future, and then kill it off. Hopefully. However, there is no way on earth that Jenner, or anyone else at the time, would have had the slightest idea why this would be the case. They thought it might work. So, they did it, and it worked. And lo, vaccination was born. It amuses to me look at articles describing the history of vaccination, and Edward Jenner, and compare them with - for example - articles on Hahnemann:'While it can scarcely compare in antiquity with Chinese or Indian medicine, homeopathy is the longest established CAM (complementary medicine) to have arisen in Europe. It was founded by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), who grew up in Meissen in Germany, received his medical degree in Erlangen in 1779, and died a millionaire in Paris in 1843. During his first fifteen years as a physician Hahnemann struggled desperately to make a living.' 4In addition to his training and experience in biology, Jenner made great progress in clinical surgery while studying with John Hunter in London ... In 1773, at the end of two years with John Hunter, Jenner returned to Berkeley to practice medicine. There he enjoyed substantial success, for he was capable, skillful, and popular. In addition to the practice of medicine, he joined two local medical groups for the promotion of medical knowledge and continued to write occasional medical papers. He also played the violin in a musical club and wrote light verse and poetry. As a natural scientist, he continued to make many observations on birds and the hibernation of hedgehogs and collected many specimens for John Hunter in London.",Vaccines - how did they come about?

The target safety level for atrazine proposed in the new regulations is based on studies which the EPA’s own panel said were of poor design. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed cracking down on a widely used agricultural herbicide, sparking outrage from farmers who say the move could raise food prices and imperil farms around the country.“Based on this reevaluation, EPA determined that this level of regulation was not appropriate and is proposing, for public comment, additional mitigation to protect aquatic plant communities,” the memo stated. The agency’s new proposal would overturn a 2020 Trump administration decision to set the CE-LOC for atrazine at 15 parts per billion (ppb) in aquatic ecosystems. CE-LOC stands for “aquatic ecosystem concentration equivalent level of concern,” which is the level at which EPA says “organisms are adversely affected” based on scientific studies. EPA now wants to lower the CE-LOC to 3.4 parts per billion, which farmers say will hamper their ability to protect their crops from weeds and use modern farming practices.“We are disappointed by EPA’s decision,” Iowa farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Chris Edgington said in a statement . “We can feed and fuel the world and fight climate change, but we can’t do these things without modern farming tools, and atrazine is a tool that is critical to our work.” The EPA’s clamp down on atrazine could exacerbate food price inflation; grocery store food purchases increased 11.9% from May 2021 to May 2022, with the prices of some food items up as much as“EPA is playing politics with this decision and should not adopt this ultra-low level of concern,” said Krissek. Kissek also said the EPA is flouting the advice of its own science advisors. In June 2012, the EPA’s Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) warned the EPA its proposal to lower atrazine’s CE-LOC relied on low-quality studies that should be disregarded. “[M]ost of the existing cosm studies with purported effects identified at atrazine concentrations less than 30 [parts per billion] have weaknesses in their design,” the panel found . “As of this date, there are no published data indicating that environmentally relevant concentrations of atrazine at or below 4 to 7 [parts per billion] cause mortality to invertebrates, fish or amphibians.” However, environmental activists filed a lawsuit in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2021, granting the EPA a voluntary partial remand, which gave the agency the opportunity to reevaluate the decision to use 15 ppb as the level of regulation for aquatic plant communities. The low-quality studies that EPA relied on supported atrazine’s low CE-LOC number (3.4ppb). The EPA ignored its own independent experts, relying on poor studies that attributed a far lower level of concern to the herbicide than the SAP studies found. “The science hasn’t changed since 2020, when EPA set the level of concern at 15 parts per billion. Atrazine has been on the market for over 60 years. No herbicide has been studied more or has a longer safety record,” Krissek said. The EPA referred TheDCNF to its statement issued at the time of the decision.

But instead of focusing on the forthcoming danger and destruction, Lemon, who recently escaped a network purge of some of the most left-wing talent at the company, attempted to turn the conversation political. During the segment, Lemon asked Acting Director of the NOAA National Hurricane Center Jamie Rohme, ‘What effect climate change has on this phenomenon,’ meaning the hurricane. Rohme quickly shut down the line of questioning, saying that he would rather focus on the present circumstances of the storm, adding, ‘I don’t think you can link climate change to any one event.’ Lemon was admonished by NOAA expert Jamie Rohme who told the CNN host it was not the time to discuss climate change as Ian prepares to slam into Florida Rohme repeatedly told Lemon climate change should not be the primary subject of discussion as the hurricane approaches the US and cautioned the host not to blame climate change for any single weather event. But Lemon pushed on, insisting that climate change was to blame for the storm, in a similar fashion to Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota), who was slammed Tuesday for suggesting that voting for members of her party in the upcoming midterm could help thwart future hurricanes and the impact of climate change. Rohme held firm though, telling Lemon, ‘climate change may be making storms worse, but to link it to any one event, I would caution against that.’ Lemon was determined to have the last word. ‘I grew up there and these storms are intensifying, something is causing them to intensify,’ he said. Lemon is in the middle of a hot streak of guests on his show pushing back on his loaded questions designed to favor liberal policy and woke talking points. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II earlier this month, Lemon was schooled on air by royal commentator Hilary Fordwich, who told Lemon that reparations for slavery are necessary – but said they should be paid by the descendants of ‘African kings’ who sold their own people into slavery. Lemon had suggested that the British royal family should pay reparations due to trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and subsequent years of colonialism for which the entity is responsible. In the interview, which went viral on Twitter this week, Fordwich responded by arguing that African leaders were responsible for supplying millions of enslaved people to European slave traders, saying that reparations should come from African nations. A stunned Lemon responded that it was an ‘interesting discussion’ and quickly concluded the interview.

3045,sgtreport-e30397a9ad42cfd57035bda14d55594e,2022-07-26 04:17:00,"QUESTION: Hi Martin, thank you as always for your incisive explanations of what’s going on in the ever-roving mind’s eye of SOCRATES. In your July 24 interview with Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog, you started to explain that a form of “Great Reset” is necessary–because taxpayers’ $ has been spent hog-wild and wilder for 90 years, with no intention or capacity forever repaying. TRUTH LIVES on at Question 1: What is the “simple Reset” financial solution you started to explain on Greg’s show? One that presumably does not involve badgering Russia into more than a conventional proxyish war. Question 2: Would you please explain how exacerbating warfare in Ukraine economically / politically benefits NATO, EU & WEF Schwab, etc in regards to their Great Defect, excuse me, Reset? What does military escalation do for a broke Europe? They aren’t the USA arms dealers’ beneficiaries. Question 3: In their feverish dreams, how would the UN exert any sensible control over the world or the Western world’s, economy that helps the Reset shamble forwards? Would the UN remain ruled by the Security Council, and would “they” try to reset the Security Council to be ruled by domino economic vassal nations numerically? In other words, will the idiots that are “they”, try to eliminate Russia and then China from the Security Council as surely as “they” bumped Russia from the SWIFT banking system with its boomerang backlash across the globe? Suppose only a few UN bureaucratic flacks can even speak Mandarin or Cantonese or Russian. How can they expect that an outer, world organization tool can exert control over the ever-changing turbulence that is these two countries? How does US benefit by denuding itself of weaponry in Europe to the degree that Taiwan is near impossible for us to defend? How does the USA benefit by easing China’s possible overthrow of the only democratic Chinese nation? Has anybody bothered to calculate & report on how much the vast digging up, refining, manufacturing then wanton exploding of natural resources as weapons & objects of weapons, across Ukraine, Europe, Syria, etc., has “contributed” to the so-called carbon pollution, climate change, Global Warming or Storming? How many cow farts must be forever silenced in the Netherlands and beyond, to make up for this pollution? Fun Bonus Question: Has SOCRATES ever been assigned the task of determining the possibilities that we all are spiraling in a global “1984” software program? And if so, what adjustments at these points in the cycles, might nudge the program dominoes away from cycling into catastrophes & endless French, Russian & Chinese style revolutionary slaughters, pogroms, exterminations, starvations, chaos, etc before emergence into. I feel that something swift & unpredictable will be upon us with an astonishing speed that shatters “boxes” of expectations. To add spice to the world’s pizza, in my meditations last week I heard the words “free energy” out of the blue. Any SOCRATES insights on this? Would the deliverer of free energy use this to control populations ever more tightly, or to free us from such centralized mischief? Thanks again Martin for hearing me muse out loud.. SU.ANSWER : Back in 2015, I held the Solution Conference . I was frightening again Klaus Schwab and I saw what was coming. So I did a Solution Conference to lay out what is now facing us today. Schwab’s “Great Reset” is authoritarian. He is like Marx and believes that we are like ants on a farm who need to be controlled. We are to become “hackable” biological entities. I really think these people got too excited watching the Matrix and thought what a great idea. Create a fake world and control everything.Now even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Canada is following the same directives from his fearless leader, Schwab is a good graduate of the WEF. Trudeau and his political counterpart in the Netherlands, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, are both trying to shut down agriculture. Schwab wants us to eat bugs. Saskatchewan and Alberta Ministers of Agriculture are expressing profound disappointment in the federal government’s fertilizer emissions reduction target. You can bet they will not be eating bugs. Trudeau has now moved on from his attack on the oil and gas industry. Now he is attacking farmers.The “simple Reset” is to do a debt-to-equity swap. That is the financial solution one must adopt to save a debt-ridden corporation. The same must be done with world governments and Scwab’s way is to default, seize authoritarian power, and institute guaranteed basic income to replace failed pensions. They believe this, with police and military, will prevent a civil uprising where people storm the parliaments or congresses.",The Solution to this Insanity

Climate data is refuting the high-warming model scenarios (‘the pause’ continues into its eighth year); consumers prefer carbon-based energies; and wind, solar, and batteries are encountering their own economic and ecological problems. Rather than moderate the exaggeration and deal with real problems, Big Environmentalismteamed with Big Wind, Big Solar, and Big EV in thewant to double down on failure. Never mind the Texas power crisis and the EU/UK gas and power crisis, each the direct and indirect result of the government-forced energy transformation to wind and solar, the unreliables. Never mind the tripartite boom in oil, gas, and coal that is refuting Net Zero by the hour. Government energy planning must continue and accelerate. Never mind consumers. Never mind taxpayers. Never mind budget deficits. Never mind the industrialized landscape from wind and solar.Here is a March 14, 2022, letter to Joe Biden signed by 89 Democrats of the House Democratic Caucuses. I intersperse my comments in green (yes, dense mineral energies are greener than dilute, intermittent substitutes). We write to thank you for your leadership in working to deliver the For The People Agenda to all Americans. Under your leadership, we passed several pieces of critical legislation to respond to the Coronavirus pandemic and to revitalize our economy. While these are significant steps forward, we still have more to achieve in accomplishing your vision for the next generation. Comment : Record inflation, anti-energy policies, record government spending, and budget deficitsthis is why Biden’s approval ratings are low and why the Party’s prospects are grim with the midterm elections later this year. As the leaders of the House Democratic Caucuses urged in a joint statement on March 1, we must take action on policies you have proposed to support American families and address the threat of climate change. The more than $555 billion in climate investments in the House-passed Build Back Better Act can serve as the building block to restart negotiations.Comment : $555 billion for what? The energies that the free market (everyday consumers) do not want? And for what climate effect decades down the road? At what cost to the pristine environment and rural communities? When it comes to addressing the crisis of our rapidly warming planet, the February 28th, 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forcefully concluded that time is running out: “Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation,” the world’s scientists wrote, “will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.” Leading the world in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require a monumental effort, and the climate components of Build Back Better are an indispensable foundation. Comment : “The ‘climate crisis’ is greatly exaggerated. The 1.5C will be here soon enougha welcomed warmth coming out of a Little Ice Age in the mid-19th century. With CO2 fertilization, look forward to more global greeningand milder winters and a reduced diurnal cycle from the enhanced greenhouse effect. Throughout 2021, we bore witness to the devastating impacts of the climate crisis, further illustrating why transformational action cannot wait. Inaction now will mean irreversible consequences for our future generations. Given the widespread agreement in the U.S. Senate for House passed climate provisions, we have an opportunity to recommence negotiations with climate serving as a key starting point. Comment : Check you data on each mentioned weather extreme. Weather is not climate.During your State of the Union address, you called for decisive action on clean energy and climate change. We were encouraged to hear you discuss how families will save an average of $500 per year on their energy costs through investments and tax credits. With your support, urging Congressional leaders to move forward with these climate provisions would mark the largest climate investment in our nation’s history, setting the United States on course to meet our 50-52% greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets by 2030, while creating millions of good paying union jobs, reducing energy costs for consumers, advancing environmental justice, investing in climate resilient housing and community infrastructure, and strengthening our economy. Comment : The politics have changed. There is some fiscal sanity to not throw good money after bad. Wind’s Production Tax Credit (PTC) does not need to beIn just the past four years, record setting wildfires, superstorms, and heat waves have already cost our country tens of billions of dollars more in damages. Damages have also included the loss of homes and the displacement of families across the countrythe effects of which disproportionately impact communities of color. It is clear that climate change is a threat multiplier to our economy. Responding now will protect American families and businesses against the most devastating financial impacts. But the longer we wait, the more expensive it will be to transition at the speed required, and we will have incurred billions in damages and harm to our communities, infrastructure, environment, and public health and safety along the way. Comment : Exaggeration backfires. Extreme weather events are not climate calamities. Check your data and report back. You will be relieved if you really believe that the trends are alarming with, etc. We are committed to working with you to realize the totality of the Building a Better America vision. Restarting negotiations with climate action is a clear path forward to deliver tangible results to the American people. Your leadership in these negotiations will ensure that we can pass on a safe, healthy, and vibrant society and planet to our children.Comment : It is safe to say that the general public is not buying climate alarmism. Citizen voters want affordable, reliable energy now, not a hypothetical tenth of a degree of avoided warming decades from now. The children, by the way, need a solvent government based on prudence regulatory and fiscal policies, not the opposite, itself the grim harvest of climate alarmism and forced energy transformation.

It’s clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn’t so clear 10 years ago… I’m 100 per cent Democrat myself, and I like Obama. But he took the wrong side on this [climate change] issue, and the Republicans took the right side…” (The Register, October 11, 2015) TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/ Dr. Ivar Giaever, Nobel-prize winner in Physics (1973), reported by Climate Depot, July 8, 2015: “Global warming is a non-problem…I say this to Obama: Excuse me, Mr. President, but you’re wrong. Dead wrong.” Green Guru James Lovelock, who once predicted imminent destruction of the planet via global warming: “The computer models just weren’t reliable. In fact, I’m not sure the whole thing isn’t crazy, this climate change.” (The Guardian, September 30, 2016) And these are but a tiny fraction of the statements made by dissident scientists who reject manmade global warming. The science is only settled in government circles where leaders have climbed on board the Globalist plan to undermine economies all over the world by grossly lowering energy production, as a way to “reduce warming.” One of the major warming hustlers is, of course, Al Gore. Consider facts laid out in an uncritical Washington Post story (October 10, 2012, “Al Gore has thrived as a green-tech investor”): In 2001, Al was worth less than $2 million. By 2012, it was estimated he’d locked up a nice neat $100 million. How did he do it? Well, he invested in 14 green companies, who inhaled — via loans, grants and tax relief — somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion from the Federal government to go greener. Therefore, Gore’s investments paid off, because the Federal government was providing massive cash backup to those companies. It’s nice to have Federal friends in high places. For example, Gore’s investment firm at one point held 4.2 million shares of an outfit called Iberdrola Renovables, which was building 20 wind farms across the United States. Iberdrola was blessed with $1.5 billion from the Federal government for the work which, by its own admission, saved its corporate financial bacon. Every little bit helps. Then there was a company called Johnson Controls. It made batteries, including those for electric cars. Gore’s investment company, Generation Investment Management (GIM), doubled its holdings in Johnson Controls in 2008, when shares cost as little $9 a share. GIM sold when shares cost $21 to $26. Note: Johnson Controls had been bolstered by $299 million dropped at its doorstep by the administration of President Barack Obama. On the side, Gore had been giving speeches on the end of life as we know it on planet Earth, for as much as $175,000 a pop. (It wasn’t really on the side. Gore was constantly on the move from conference to conference, spewing jet fumes in his wake.) Those lecture fees can add up. So Gore, as of 2012, had $100 million. The man has worked every angle to parlay fear of global-warming catastrophes into a humdinger of a personal fortune. And he didn’t achieve his new status in the free market. The Federal government has been helping out with major, major bucks. This wasn’t an entrepreneur relying exclusively on his own smarts and hard work.Far from it. — How many scientists and other PhDs have been just saying no to the theory of manmade global warming? A letter to The Wall Street Journal signed by 16 scientists just said no. Among the luminaries: William Happer, professor of physics at Princeton University; Richard Lindzen, professor of atmospheric sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; William Kininmonth, former head of climate research at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. And then there was the Global Warming Petition Project, or the Oregon Petition, that just said no.

But when they’re right they’re right) has branded US and UK hypocrites on press freedom over the looming extradition of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to face espionage charges that could land the Australian in jail for life. Assange’s extradition to the US to face charges over the leaking of thousands of official secrets has been approved by British Home Secretary Priti Patel after a protracted legal battle.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin accused the US of pursuing ‘trumped up’ charges against Assange for exposing secrets about the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and about the CIA’s cyber attacks against other countries. 3.

No way to verify it but the audio and video seem too closely synched to me. Typically you see an explosion before you hear it. Lightening Thunder.

Texas Republicans are pushing for a referendum to decide whether the state should secede from the U.S. The demand for Texans to be allowed to vote on the issue in 2023 was one of many measures adopted in the Texas GOP’s party platform following last week’s state convention in Houston. Under a section titled “State Sovereignty,” the platform states: “Pursuant to Article 1, Section 1, of the Texas Constitution, the federal government has impaired our right of local self-government. Therefore, federally mandated legislation that infringes upon the 10th Amendment rights of Texas should be ignored, opposed, refused, and nullified. “Texas retains the right to secede from the United States, and the Texas Legislature should be called upon to pass a referendum consistent thereto.” (The Newsweek article goes on to explain that no, all states are screwed and no one can leave the union for any reason whatsoever. Hence the reason for a second amendment in this author’s opinion. The 2020 election was clearly stolen by any metric and anyone would have to agree based on publicly agreed on information irrespective of things like 2000 Mules. Had Biden lost the Democrats would demand it be redone if Twitter had thrown Biden off the platform and all his supporters minimized in their algorithm. Had Facebook made it impossible for the Democrats to raise funds and had all the legacy media pushed a story about Biden and Russia they knew was not true, and had the FBI held on to critical information about the Trump family and his sons that would have changed people’s minds during the election campaign. The Democrats would have claimed a fix, and they would have been right. So forgetting ALL the technical cheats, and forgetting that Biden specifically said: “We have put together, and you guys did it for President Obama’s administration before this, we have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics” from his own senile mouth, the election was rigged and Texas should secede.

Remember that moment { HERE } when Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland seemed really uncomfortable and weird at the presser – just 36 hours before the Trudeau administration announced they were going to drop the Emergency Act banking sanctions against the truckers? {TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/ Here is an encapsulation of what’s weird, and you don’t have to be an expert in geopolitics and international trade to see it: The G7 countries (including the U.S.) announced today they were demanding that Russia accept payment for oil and gas in euros and dollars. This is happening at the same time NATO is demanding (via sanctions) that Russia be blocked from accepting payments in euros and dollars. Something is weird. Keep in mind, the same nations in the G7 are the same nations in NATO with the exception of Japan (G7 only). The only way this conflict could make any sense, is if the G7 energy ministers realize that forcing Russia to trade in non-euros and non-dollars will structurally undermine the G7 unilateral hold of global finance and energy policy. In essence, the G7 see the non-sanction countries, particularly India and China, lining up to replace the petro-dollar, and that not only weakens their position financially, but it also weakens their climate change position. Saudi Arabia is not returning phone calls from the Biden administration, and the extended OPEC-plus are not following the sanctions regime of the western NATO alliance. Which makes sense, because Opec+ includes Russia, and the geopolitical dynamic appears to have fractured around the energy sector, with the western alliance chasing renewable energy and the non-sanction countries staying on course with oil and gas. The conflicting position toward Russia, insofar as the G7 demands they keep selling using euros/dollars while NATO demands Russia stop receiving euros/dollars, remains brutally stark. It is a conflicting interest, within the same policies, within the same geopolitical group. Behind the G7 and NATO, we know the multinational corporations assembled in the World Economic Forum are ultimately the driver of political policy. The central bankers, finance ministers and politicians all operate under the guidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank (WB) and World Trade Organization (WTO). Together the WEF, IMF, WB, WTO, EU central banks and U.S. federal reserve, collectively represent what we call the globalists. And the globalists are pushing the climate change agenda hard {The conflicting position, with G7 energy ministers demanding Russia accept payments in Euros/Dollars, can only be reconciled if the globalist crew is worried about the fracturing we have previously discussed. {However, if the globalist team only just now realized their sanctions have created a cleaving of the world energy trade system using dollars to pay for oil/gas purchases, and by extension this weakens their objective to force everyone to accept climate change objectives, they would be fools. Something weird is going on here. I’m not certain what it is, but I am confident something really odd is again happening in the background. It is always important to remember the ultimate goal of the ‘climate change’ promotors is not an energy system that changes the global climate. The goal of the ‘climate change’ group is to create a carbon trading system; a new financial mechanism (a global tax program) to control human activity on a world-wide basis. This system also needs a digital identity in order to work. As a consequence, when we look at the fracturing of the global energy marketplace, it is worth viewing the divided group through the prism of the globalist carbon trading scheme. My hunch is the demand for Russia to accept payment in euros and dollars is directly connected to the G7 worrying about losing climate change leverage with the non-sanction countries around the issue of energy. For the globalists, it’s not just the loss of the petro-dollar at stake, it’s losing the accompanying leverage they have to enforce their climate change mission. That’s the only thing that makes this internal conflict make sense.",Did the Globalists Just Flinch on Russian Sanctions in Order to Keep Control of Global Climate Change Goals?

He called the bill a “terrible deal.” “We should not be greasing the skids this week for the Democrats to spend $250 billion so they can spend another $500 billion next week,” Cotton outlined. “That’s only going to add to the record-high inflation Joe Biden has already created, and now that we are in a recession, the tax increases are only going to kill your jobs. This is a terrible deal, and we have to stop it.” “This bill is going to fuel even more inflation.

First is concerning the rise of Covid-19 cases. When over 70% of the US population have already been inoculated with either the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine and when the President just came down with Covid-19 after being vaccinated with three additional booster shots doesn’t that indicate that this so-called vaccine is totally ineffective and actually increases, the likelihood of contracting Covid-19 and even many other illnesses? Doesn’t this also indicate that once people have been subjected and inoculated with this experimental vaccine a person’s immune system has been compromised? Another disturbing question is why is the pharmaceutical industry trying to impose their sanctions on the Vitamin supplement industry? Today more than 95% of our population is deficient in one vitamin or another. And this deficiency causes the immune system to be compromised. Is this part of another scheme to generate more dependence of the pharmaceutical industry just to increase their profit margin? We know for a fact that Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin D and Magnesium are all essential in preventing many illnesses. One has to wonder considering that many traditional homemade remedies that worked in prevention and cures have now been unavailable. With the United States facing the highest inflationary rate in over 40 years why is the present Administration funding the war in Ukraine with millions of taxpayer dollars? Why are we sending millions of additional dollars of armaments to Ukraine at a time when millions of Americans are starving to death, thrown out of their homes, and can’t afford gas to get to work for a substandard living wage? These are just some of the questions that the American public have to be aware of. There are others concerning just how the elite power structure that has existed for years is dominating and exerting their complete control over the lives of millions of Americans. Ou free will. is being stripped away by a power structure in the form Biden Administration just authorized the sale of millions of barrels of oil from our strategic oil reserves to China and India when China is already buying oil from Russia.

Considering a variety of dimensions, it is probably not far from the truth. Switzerland is home to a number of highly dubious institutions and organizations. Take the World Economic Forum (WEF) – the unelected NGO, with its unelected master, Klaus Schwab , based in Cologny, suburb of Geneva. This unelected but dirty-rich body of “luminaries”, with tax-free status, pretends to decide over our future, the future of the world, and literally, the future of mankind. TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/ Once a year, mostly in the second half of January, the WEF unites some 2000 to 3000 oligarchs and wannabe luminaries in Davos, Switzerland, to ruminate (often in secret chambers off the madding crowd) on how to make the world a better place. No, not for us the people, but for themselves, the elite. Their private-jet pilgrimage to Switzerland leaves a carbon footprint behind, that is like blatantly spitting in the face of their “climate change” agenda, imposed on the world. This year, 2022, has been a “covid-exception”, and the word-shaking get-together took place in May, still in Davos, under the usual heavy police and secret service protection. But with a reduced number of luminaries and world leaders. It smells a bit like “deglobalization”.Second, Switzerland is also home of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a colossal round tower, bearing similarities to the depictions of the “Tower of Babel” which is said to having been built as an act of rebellion against God. Is the physical similarity of the two towers a strange coincidence? – See The BIS is located in Basle, at the border to Germany. It was created in 1930 with the stated objective to “managing” Germany’s debt payments to the winners of WWI. In reality, it was rather used to prepare and fund WWII. The BIS channeled money from the US Federal Reserve (FED) to Hitler’s Germany – including to finance Hitler’s war, especially against the Soviet Union. The first Chairman and President of the BIS (1930-1933) was Gates McGarrah The BIS’ official role was “clearing German reparations and interallied debts and to develop new facilities for international banking.” Interestingly, Gates McGarrah, was appointed on August 30, 1924, as the American director of the General Council of the Reichsbank, the central bank of Germany, created in 1876 until 1945. This job he carried out partially in parallel with his assignment as Chairman and President of the BIS from which he retired in 1933. See The US is known for dancing on several fiestas at the same time. In this case they funded their WWII enemy, Adolf Hitler, to fight the USSR, officially an US ally against Germany. The funding was channeled through the BIS in Basle. The Soviet Union suffered enormous losses (estimates vary from 25 and 30 million), but the Soviet army defeated Hitler’s army, which was the beginning of the downfall of Germany’s Nazism. There is no question why Russia’s President Putin is dead-set against the Nazi-leadership and Nazi military forces – the Azov Battalions – in Ukraine. The Azov Battalion(s) fought with Hitler’s Nazi army during WWII against the Soviet Union. Today, the BIS, an extremely secretive agency, still sits in Basle, in a Babel-shaped tower, managing the pyramid funds of the western monetary system – through the system’s central banks around the world. The building has several underground floors, where it stores a large portion of the gold reserves and other assets of the world’s central banks. The BIS is largely owned by the Rothschild family, which de facto , has an enormous “outreach” over the globe’s financial system – the multitude of currencies, of which most of the western ones gradually have become fiat currencies, following the image of the US dollar, according to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. Since 2001, the Euro, often referred to as the little brother of the US dollar, follows the same fraudulent pyramid doctrine. Third, Switzerland has also one of the world’s most secret international banking systems with tentacles of services and networks reaching around the globe. Despite many “attempts” by foreign countries, especially the US, to breaking the Swiss banking secrecy, it has never really been broken, because of the high-powered international oligarchs and financial institutions, who have a vital interest in the secretive banking pivot Switzerland. The Pandemic Treaty: World Health Tyranny. Finally, but by no means least, Switzerland is also home to the World Health Organization (WHO) – which is now being groomed to take over the 194 member countries’ health sovereignty, through a so-called “Pandemic Treaty”. This would literally make of WHO a WHT — a World Health Tyranny. So far, t he first voting round last week was lost for WHO, mostly thanks to a block of some 47 African countries , voting against it. But by no means is this the end. The Pandemic Treaty was a proposal of the Biden Administration – observe: “Democrats”. But it was immediately supported by Switzerland, the EU and a host of other mostly western countries. This Pandemic Treaty, if implemented, will change the global landscape and strip you and me of some of our most basic rights and freedoms. Make no mistake, the WHO Pandemic Treaty is a direct attack on the sovereignty of its member states, as well as a direct attack on your bodily autonomy.

It is the End of “Representative Democracy” Although the Pandemic Treaty was already proposed in December 2021, and, of course, welcomed by the Swiss Government, it was not before April that the Swiss public at large became aware of it. Secrecy and dictatorship have long become the norm, and we are still fantasizing about “democracy”? Switzerland, the Head of the Beast, is well aware of the illegal and more than questionable machination playing out on her territory. It’s more: Switzerland encourages them and pulls together all the key strings: The world’s central banking (BIS); the WEF, master of globalization, “penetrating” (Klaus Schwab’s term) governments around the world with WEF scholars from the WEF academy of “Young Global Leaders”; and last but not least, the World Health Organization, alias the World Health Tyranny.",Switzerland’s Secretive Banking System and the WEF’s “Great Reset”: First in “You’ll Own Nothing and You’ll be Happy”?

The cases go on, but in its general usage thick libertarianism is often understood as any libertarianism that sees ideas such as feminism, anti-racism, queer liberation, egalitarianism, and environmentalism as essential to any libertarian program internally and therefore desirable for external proliferation in a libertarian society. I have written extensively about thick libertarianism: inI argue that thickness is one of the defining qualities that places stateless left-libertarianism within and anarcho-capitalism outside of the anarchist canon; etc. However, I have yet to explicitly connect my endorsement of thick libertarianism with material analysis (in its dialectical form)my favored lens when attempting to make sense of the world. I will therefore take an opportunity to do so with this piece. A final point I made in the aforementioned philosophy presentation was that such liberatory thickness or, as I put it, ideologico-cultural values extend to the economic realm and entail anti-hierarchy, cooperation, and worker power in the form of cooperatives, an ethico-cultural labor theory of value, “[c]ommunity land trusts, community currencies, open source technology, mutual banks, etc.” There is nothing wrong with this model from a purely individualist anarchist perspective, however I think thatfrom my personal perspectivethis logic is a bit backwards. That is to say: it is actually the economic base that produces ideologico-cultural values and culture in general. This is in accordance with Karl Marx’s and Friedrich Engels’s model of historical materialism, whichas “the Marxist theory of history and society that holds that ideas and social institutions develop only as the superstructure of a material economic base.” According to this view, society forms around the means of productionl and, labor, tools, machineryand the relations of productionproperty distribution, class divisions, the commodity formto constitute, as Marx writes in A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy , on“the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness” and, based on this core analysis, he posits in The German Ideology that “[t]he nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.” It is important to note however that the influence is not entirely unidirectional. The, has been used to “divide an d rule for capitalist gain.” Historically this can be seen in “the transatlantic slave trade, which accompanied the birth of both U.S. and British capitalism. In the early days of slavery, a firm distinction hadn’t yet been drawn between black slaves and white indentured servants.” So in order to quell the possibility of multi-racial rebellions, “the U.S. ruling class developed racist theories to ‘prove’ the inferiority of blacks, doing so to drive a wedge between their subjects, undercut rebellion and to justify their enslavement.” This has continued into the present day through “codifying [racism] in law, funding racist ‘science’ and broadening its scope . . . [in order for] the capitalists to drive down wages, while creating a seemingly infinite set of divisions in the working class.” Additionally,, who are attempting to “ develop a cooperative network based in Jackson, Mississippi” built upon the “basic theory of change . . . that organizing and empowering the structurally under and unemployed sectors of the working class, particularly from Black and Latino communities, to build worker organized and owned cooperatives will be a catalyst for the democratization of our economy and society overall.” Such a project addresses the immediate material concerns of anti-racists through community-based businesses, a living wage, non-hierarchical work relationships, etc. but on another level help produce anti-racist values . T he main thrust of this argument is that if racism thrives in helping capitalism accomplish its imperatives of controlling the working class and expanding extraction/production, then this specific catalyst for racism can be challenged through the creation of economic communitiessuch as that promoted by Cooperation Jacksonseparate from the logic of capitalism; opening up spaces for conversation, accountability, and reparations without the interference of Capital [1]. To somewhat bastardize a quote from La Grotta’s piece, the potential of this project is not “ that racist beliefs die as soon as capitalism disappears” or, in this model, is pushed back from autonomous spaces, it is that itand criticized in the same breath for still participating in the logic of capitalism as units of the market economy. But what I think this analysis misunderstands is that present existence and imperatives of ‘the market’ revolve primarily around state-sanctioned/state-enforced monopolies and direct interference by the corporate state. Since this state-capitalist influence over market action is originally rooted in violence and/or threat of violence wielded by the state, strategies that work to dissuade or circumvent said violencesuch as radical community self-defense and agorist practicescan make it possible to utilize markets autonomously of the present economy. Another example of the connection between (dialectical) materialism and thick libertarianism is the way in which not only democratizing but also localizing the material base of society can help make individuals and communities more environmentally conscious and defensive. Localization, according tothat localization “ also contributes to resiliency in the face of climate change: diverse localized production systems in an interdependent network, rather than dependence for our basic needs on far-off sources, will better equip communities to withstand the upheavals to come.” Internal to this localization is ideally the proliferation of cooperative enterprises to fill out community economies, which the UN sees as helping to ensure “sustainable consumption and production.” Although the UN’s vision of cooperatives is more globalized than localized, they do give the good examples of the IMAI Farming Cooperative in South Africa: “a women’s cooperative that has partnered with non-profits and government institutions to turn surplus fresh vegetable produce into pickles. Through this initiative the cooperative increases the incomes of its members by adding value to their products while also reducing food waste.” They also write of the Association of Recycling Collectors and Sorters of La Paz in Bolivia, who “formed a cooperative in 2006 to overcome the waste collection challenges. Their 40 members earn a better income through recycling in total about 194 tonnes of solid waste on a daily basis, including plastic, cardboard, metals, used clothing, glass and occasionally e-waste,” the last of which is sold at an “informal market.” Even specimens provided by the UN that are linked up with longer supply chains and multiple production or sale locations would seem to be more closely controlled by communities; and while these are only preliminary in terms of the local cooperativization of the means of production it does provide a glimpse of the future as well as a proof of concept [2].for “ direct confrontation with our current hierarchical conditions . . . [by] seizing the land and resources out of the hands of Capitalists and into our own. Such conditions would mean a direct interaction with individuals and their communities in regards to their immediate biological surroundings, allowing them to make rational decisions based within the knowledge and understanding that comes with localized living.” This new control over property by the masses as opposed to a small group of capitalists leads to “direct power to affect a meaningful relationship with the biosphere” and therefore the de-alienation of people from their local environment, allowing people to “protect the biosphere as an extension of ourselves.” Additionally, environmental conservatives in the UK have latched on to the idea of “oikophilia,” a term originating in the work of Roger Scruton and defined by Sarah Newton as “a family of motives at whose centre is love of one’s home.” The context of this idea within conservative politics runs the risk of engendering ethnocentrism, xenophobia, nationalism, and other deeply undesirable ‘values,’ but I do not believe there is anything inherent in it that would not allow both a love of local multiculturalism and a pursuit of something like(the latter being environmentalist thinker Wolfgang Sachs’s idea of a networked linking of mutually supportive communities across the globe). In a more general sense, oikophilia is used, as it is by Newton, to simply describe an impulse to protect one’s home including (and often especially) the environment. The idea is that when one witnesses “decreases in wildlife or flooding as a result of extreme weather” and other consequences of climate change there is a “natur al urge for people to want to work together to protect their environment.” Coupled with the localized ability to actually affect change in their households and communities through such projects as green energy neighborhood planning and local enterprise initiatives, this urge finds a material footing and is therefore able to flourish. I would argue this would be even more the case if the projects extended beyond the status quo economics of UK conservatives and into the localized, democratic market system gestured toward throughout this piece. The illustrations of how alteration of the material base can cause shifts in cultural values (and in turn reinforce those alterations) go on and onone might consider looking into the material social construction of gender roles (as theorized by Marxist and materialist feminists) or the understanding of queerphobia and cishetetonormativity as being schemes of Capital to enforce both the standardized reproduction of the workforce and the restricted commodification of difference. Although starting a cooperative will not magically make everyone an anti-racist or an environmentalist, as part of a broader movement toward localization of politico-economic power and autonomy from state-capitalism, a mass cooperative movement could begin to make a series of changes in the material base and thereby also the superstructure (particularly cultural values). All left-libertarians already support cooperatives wholeheartedlyeither as an acceptable or ideal form of market entitywith much of the call for the labor theory of value, mutual banking, and the common ownership of natural resources centering around allowing for workers to collectively generate and operate enterprises free from capitalist clutches. Additionally, Kevin Carsonone of the most prominent theorists of left-libertarianismhas theorized in such pieces as",Materialism and Thick Libertarianism
